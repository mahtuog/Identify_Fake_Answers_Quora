4,"Since 2013, Data Science scene in India has really flourished. There is a lot more awareness about data science. The job opportunities have increased. Seeing this there are many institutes offering data science courses online like Udemy, Coursera, Simplilearn etc. that you can join.All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. Data Science is one such profession where you need to have classroom experience as well. You can choose online training for the basics but you have to undergo classroom training for the advance part of it.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program over a course. As programme is more purpose focused enlightening complete domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused where you can only upgrade limited number of skills. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence you going for a program would be recommendable.One should always go for a program which is onsite, instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an programEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAlso your program should ideally include the topics mentioned below in order to deliver a complete package.Basics of R & Python programmingExploratory Data Analysis with Excel, RLinear Regression, its variations and Industry ProjectDecision Trees, Ensemble & ClassificationClusteringTime Series RegressionData Bases & Big Data EcosystemData Visualization, story telling, dashboarding, TableauBuilding production scale data science products and their deploymentBig Data Engineering, Deep Learning & Tensor Flow, NLPDisclaimer: I am a co-founder @GreyAtom and assist engineering talents kickstart their career in emerging technologies.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career.

After working on SAS for more than 5 years, I decided to move out of my comfort zone. Being a data scientist, my hunt for other useful tools was ON! Fortunately, it didn’t take me long to decide, Python was my appetizer.I always had a inclination towards coding. This was the time to do what I really loved. Code. Turned out, coding was so easy!I learned basics of Python within a week. And, since then, I’ve not only explored this language to the depth, but also have helped many other to learn this language. Python was originally a general purpose language. But, over the years, with strong community support, this language got dedicated library for data analysis and predictive modeling.Due to lack of resource on python for data science, I decided to create this tutorial to help many others to learn python faster. In this tutorial, we will take bite sized information about how to use Python for Data Analysis, chew it till we are comfortable and practice it at our own end.Reading several books on data science also help me a lot in building my confidence in learning data science.Verhoef, Kooge and Walk have written a detailed and technical book on the application of data analytics to Marketing. While not stated in the title, the subtitle makes it clear: the book is dedicated to people in Marketing and Sales.The strong academic background of the authors is transparent in the book, which is full of references. In the book, Big Data means lots of data (nothing related to Big Data architectures). While written with an academic angle, the book is full of examples. Marketing topics covered include brand metrics, value to consumer/firm and customer lifetime value (CLV).On the data science side, while not going deep in the subjects, the book discusses data quality, privacy & ethics, customer segmentation, regression models and time series. In the “Big Data” category, the books covers web analytics, A/B tests, dynamic targeting and social network analysis.Creating Value with Big Data Analytics also discusses storytelling concepts. Finally, Big Data capabilities within companies are covered. The very last chapter provides several use cases. If you work in applying data science to Marketing/Sales, you will find Creating Value with Big Data Analytics useful. It provides both an overview of the field and a starting point for further readings.","Updated May 11, 2018",1,", lives in New Delhi (2000-present)",https://www.quora.com/profile/Amit-Kataria-19,5,Amit Kataria,https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-delhi,0.0

8,"The obvious thing when you look at all the answers on this question is that they are all from various institutes promoting themselves as the best and not from any third party course takers. Should you believe those answers then? Instead ask yourself what exactly defines a “best institute” or an institute where you would like to learn. Here are some points which will help you find the best institute. For each of those points rank the institutes you research out of 10 points, total it up and then the highest point getter is your best institute:High quality faculty: Would you learn from someone who is a university prof and has never worked in the industry and hence doesn’t know the practical applications? Or would you learn from someone who has just completed a course and for want of anything else to do has started teaching? Or would you learn from someone who probably has less than a years worth of experience? Or would you rather learn from data scientists who have spent at least 3 years in the industry, worked on multiple business problems from different domains, faced various tricky situations and know the tips and tricks which when taught to you would enable you to be a cut above the rest?You will find institutes with each of such kind of faculty and your answer should be obvious. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Also why have I rated this factor higher than jobs or placements. That’s because while an institute may or may not succeed in getting you a job, if you are trained well then you yourself will find a job on your own.2. High quality curriculum: How good is the curriculum in terms of the coverage of the field? Does it cover all the requirements of the industry to help you be effective in interviews? Does it start from the basics and properly cover them, if you are a newbie? Is the course duration sufficient to cover all the topics effectively or is it too short or long?There are many institutes providing you courses which are between 20 hours and 300 hours. Some will just provide an overview of the topics while others will unnecessarily elongate everything and add in pointless topics so as to charge you more money under the guise of a university diploma. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Remember higher the no. of hours or more the modules doesn’t mean its a good curriculum. Again better the curriculum, better your learning and better your chances of a job.3. Practical content: How can you rate content when you don’t have access to it? What you have to do is look at the practical aspects of the curriculum. Figure out whether each of the modules are explained using practical examples or not? Ask how many case studies and assignments are there? Check if those case studies are reasonably good enough to help you understand the module. Don’t bother about size of data etc. as that’s meaningless. Check how many projects do you get to work on? These projects are important because that’s what you will eventually put on your CV to get a job. So these projects should be good and possibly from different domains.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Again more practical the content, better your learning and better your chances of a job.4. Support: Is there anyone working full-time in the institute who can help resolve your doubts outside the class, as the faculty maybe a working professional with no time during non-class days? How good is the support and how many different channels of support are available? Apart from this you need to figure out how flexible is the institute with regards to your issues. Do they allow you to transfer batches if you can’t continue in your current one? Do they allow you to extend any submission deadlines as you maybe a busy working professional?On the whole how supportive are they of you having a comfortable and good learning experience. Checking past reviews would help here. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Better the support, better your learning and better your chances of a job.5. Reviews: How good are the reviews for the institute so far? Yes, reviews on websites would obviously be good but check third party reviews like Google reviews for instance to see what other students have felt in the past. Look at the ratio of negative to positive reviews.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Lower the negative to positive review ratio, better the institute.6. Certification: Many of you may feel that this a very important criteria. However as far as certifications go, data science employers are not that concerned. You will hardly find any job description which asks for a particular institute certification. All they are looking for is hands-on project work.Yes a good certificate will help your resume stand-out but what kind of certificate? For a certificate to stand-out on your resume. it has to be something rare and hard to get. Just like an IIT stands out on the resume vs. a local engineering college, similarly the certificate is something which should be hard to get. Hence certificates from Coursera, Edx, Udemy etc. just won’t count as tens of thousands will have one. Corporate tie-ups for a certification are even more useless because if that particular corporate doesn’t hire you, then no one else would.Instead to gauge the value of an institute’s certificate you should look at the no. of company association’s it has in terms of training or certifying company employees. More and better the companies which the institute has trained better its certificate would be in getting you a job. This does get a bit complex though as many institutes would just put up a list of companies without having any associations with them.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points as there’s no way you can really know the truth.7. Jobs and placements: No institute on earth including the top universities of the world would give you any kind of placement guarantee’s. So let’s get that out of the way. Think like the grown-up that you are and realise that getting a job at this career stage is 80% in your hands and 20% in the institute’s. Yes, many institute’s will assert that they have 100% placements etc. and some will even say “100% placement assistance” or “100% placement support” in a bid to make it look as if they provide jobs to everyone whereas all they are going to do is provide assistance of some sort.Don’t bother asking for placement records as you will only end up with a random statistic. Instead what you need to see is how well they can assist you in getting a job because face it getting a job is in your hands. See if they will help you with creating a good resume, preparing for interviews and the kind of opportunities and companies that come to them looking to hire. Check the success stories of their students and talk to those people. Check the third party reviews.If any institute ever talks about giving you guaranteed placements, take it in writing from them with all the relevant terms and conditions along with the companies, roles and salaries offered. If the same is refused or offered partially don’t believe them. Also get a money-back guarantee in writing if they fail to place you.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points.8. Fees or value for money: Eventually fees will matter though the amount should not be the criteria. Of course your paying or borrowing capacity will eventually decide which institute you select but remember just because an institute is cheap doesn’t mean that is what you should select. The criteria should be where you are getting your bang for the buck. Where on the above criteria do you get the most value for the fee you have to pay is what should help you decide.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points.So there you are, 100 points across 8 areas to rank your institutes under consideration on.Areas which you should not bother about are:Online vs. Classroom: Seriously just don’t worry about this aspect. I know some of you may disagree with me but having run both online and classroom programs, I know that the learning experience is not at all different. In fact online works way better because of better faculty from around the world, more flexibility and ability to revisit classes through videos.External Rankings: External rankings will keep changing based on different criteria and the ranking agency’s methods. Instead create your own through your research and based on what is important for you.Now that you know what to evaluate on, why not evaluate Edvancer (Analytics Training -Business Analytics, Big Data, Data Science) on these criteria and see if we rank anywhere in your best institute list.","Answered May 26, 2018 · Author has 57 answers and 236.4k answer views",2,", works at Edvancer Eduventures",https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-delhi/answers/84924265,8,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-delhi,0.0

10,"Pertaining to Data Science training, if one has to succeed, master the concepts and crack the job, following factors are important. At ExcelR, they ensure that learning is blended with these differentiators. It’s a lengthy answer I gave, but worth taking the effort as one should choose a right learning partner as it’s a significant career changing decision1) Good Faculty with hands on experience2) Course Curriculum3) E-learning videos to recap the concepts4) Assignments5) Projects6) Blended Training Model7) Accessibility to contact faculty8) Post Training support9) Placement Assistance10) Peer support11) Feedback from past participants12) Cost effective course fee13) International Certification14) Access to the complementary coursesGood Faculty with Hand on Experience:Faculty is our forte. All our trainers are working as Data Scientists in various top notch multinational organizations with over 15+ years professional experience. They carry excellent technical and domain knowledge and considered to be the best in the industry. Majority of the trainers are alumni of premier institutes such as IIT, IIM, Indian School of Business (ISB) and a few hold Ph.D qualification.At ExcelR, we hand pick the trainers subsequent to a thorough evaluation of knowledge, presentation skills, experience and passion for training. No wonder that our trainers are considered to be the best in the industry. We have in-house trainers who will ensure accessibility all throughout the training. Testimonials/Reviews given by our students endorse about the quality of our trainers and training. With a clause which says 70% of the time our trainers have to work on projects and 30% of their time they have to deliver trainings, participants can be rest assured about the real-life practical exposure along-side theory.Course Curriculum:Agenda is another key factor that needs to be considered in any training. Our Data Science course curriculum has been tailored to the needs of the industry. At ExcelR, we do a thorough research on the changing needs of the industry. We collate the topics in demand from our participants who secured jobs, working Data Scientists, industry stalwarts in Data Science and the organizations pertaining to various domains. On an average, we refine the agenda a minimum of 3 times a year with latest topics.ExcelR’s course agenda covers the entire data lifecycle starting from extraction of data, cleansing, structuring, Data Mining (Data Analysis), Forecasting and reporting. Our course starts with Basic Statistics (is a must for every participant as knowledge of basic statistics is required to master the advanced concepts) and topics such as Hypothesis testing, Regression Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Data Mining/Machine Learning, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Forecasting, Data Visualization, Deep Learning, Big Data Hadoop, Spark, etc., will be covered extensively.Tools covered as part of the training are R & R studio, Python, NodeXL, XLMiner, Minitab and Tableau.We cover every topic that is required, to land you in a job in a short period of time.E-learning Videos to Recap the Concepts:At ExcelR, we provide you with the complete course videos on all topics in the agenda recorded from renowned Data Scientist from ISB. Participants can watch the video before, during and after the training which helps to revise and recap the concepts. In addition to this, every virtual live online session will be recorded and shared on our Learning Management System (LMS). Participants can use the recorded sessions to recap or to watch the missed classes.Here is One of the recorded sessions:Assignments:ExcelR provides 60+ assignments for practicing the theoretical concepts. Getting your hands dirty is key to master the concepts. With every concept that is taught, a related assignment will be given to ensure hands on experience. We have a separate SME team to help with your assignments, evaluate and give the feedback. All the assignments are devised to include the real-world challenges in dealing with data so that you are market ready and fair exceptionally well in interviews.Projects:ExcelR has myriad live projects to work upon. Participants should work on 2 Live projects chosen by them on the domain of their choice. This helps the participants to gain the big picture, simulating the live analytics projects lifecycle. This live project exposure happens through ExcelR’s analytics consulting vertical, Innodatatics, which is a USA based firm. You get a chance to work alongside our team of data scientists. This is going to provide the actual exposure you are looking out for before facing any data science interview.Blended Training Model:Data science is relatively a complex subject. Attending a classroom or online training may not be sufficient to absorb and assimilate the concepts. So, we devised a blended model of learning. In this model, participants avail themselves classroom, live online and e-learning (recorded sessions) with a single enrollment. A combination of these 3 will produce a synergistic impact on the learning. One can attend multiple Live online sessions from different trainers at no additional cost.Accessibility to Contact Faculty:All throughout the training and post training period, one trainer will be given as your mentor who does the required hand holding. Trainer can be contacted through phone / WhatsApp for any doubts clarification or necessary guidance. Trainer also helps you by providing guidance on strengthening your weakness so that you outshine and outsmart the moment you attend the interview.Post Training Support:Post training support is key to procure a job for any technology. As mentioned earlier, a dedicated trainer will be given as mentor. Project support, WhatsApp support will ensure that participants master the concepts without any hassles. Daily interview questions will be posted so that your interview preparation start right from day one. These questions are composed by our trainers based on their experience and based on the interaction with the participants who attended interviews and got jobs in data science.Placement Assistance:Subsequent to the completion of training, assignments and projects placement assistance will kick start. Help will be rendered in terms of resume building, FAQs for the interviews, one-to-one discussion on job description during interview calls, etc. A couple of mock interviews (one on one / telephonic) will be conducted by the SMEs to evaluate the grey areas and areas of strength. This helps the participant to retrospect and understand their interview readiness. Participant can attend and successfully crack the interviews with complete confidence.ExcelR has tied up with myriad IT companies to supply the resources in the space of Analytics. Subsequent to a thorough preparation, interviews will be facilitated with our partner IT companies.These are a few reasons of ExcelR’s high placement record in the industry.Peer Support:We ensure that past participants from ExcelR who secured jobs in the space of Data Science will help the current participants who are undergoing the training. They share their experiences and also provide guidance to fellow participants, which helps the participants with their preparation.Feedback from Past Participants:One may feel that we boast about ourselves about our training, but the reviews and feedback from participants will give the true picture about our quality and care. Check our Google reviews which endorses us.Affordable Course Fee:One can compare the agenda/facilities against the course fee we provide with other training providers. We challenge that no others can beat us. The takeaway one would get for the price is no way comparable in the industry. If you can find someone who can match us we give your money back. No questions asked because we believe in providing value for money.International Certification:ExcelR has tied up with UNIMAS university (UNIVERSTI MALAYSIA SARAWAK), Malaysia. Participants would get the certificate from the university of UNIMAS subsequent to exam and project submission. UNIMAS is the university owned by Government of Malaysia and is ranking in the top 200 universities in Asia.Access to complementary courses:Participants will be given complimentary access to e-learning courses like Big Data Hadoop, Core Python, Tableau and Webinars on latest happenings, etc. This will help to cross skill on various skillsets which overlap with Data Science domain.","Answered Aug 24, 2018",1,", former Digital Marketing & Data Science Expert",https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Gaddam-4,10,Raghu Gaddam,https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-delhi,0.0

20,"Since 2013, Data Science scene in India has really flourished. There is a lot more awareness about data science. The job opportunities have increased. Seeing this there are many institutes offering data science courses online like Udemy, Coursera, Simplilearn etc. that you can join.All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. Data Science is one such profession where you need to have classroom experience as well. You can choose online training for the basics but you have to undergo classroom training for the advance part of it.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program over a course. As programme is more purpose focused enlightening complete domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused where you can only upgrade limited number of skills. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence you going for a program would be recommendable.One should always go for a program which is onsite, instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science.

Big Data, Data Science - Combo Course Training Classes Online | Big Data, Data Science - Combo Course Courses OnlineThe world today is getting ‘Big Data’ crazy, and data scientist is the hottest job yet again this year. But the dilemma is to choose what skills will get you identified by top employers. It is a major concern of major professionals and students that if they know Java, will it be helpful in driving the career to the Data Scientist level? What are those certain skills that increase your credibility even more and force employers to choose you over others?Recently, Data Science crowd sourcing specialist, Crowd Flower Inc. surveyed to identify what are the most-wanted Data Science skills that will give you the top-row ticket in your dream company. The experts analyzed more than 3500 job positions on the popular professional website, for data science jobs and created a report with the real-time data. It has listed top 21 individual skills that are most frequently expected from a data science professional. The results bring forward the best to guide you in acquiring brilliant jobs with high salaries and even prepare for your Professional Certification Course – CCP: DS.No wonder, SQL sits in the top position for you to develop as a data scientist. SQL is the most looked for competence if you want to make a big difference and be productive from day1. More than 55% of the job postings relating to this discipline on LinkedIn require expertise in SQL. Hadoop raised its graph for the second position. As evident, data science is a lot about dealing with excessively growing data and no technology than Hadoop has until now made it to the first place. In context to the rankings, CEO and founder of Crowd Flower said, “It’s not surprising the two skills that are at the top are SQL and Hadoop, which are the technologies that actually store the data,” He further mentions, “Every data scientist has to know how to get the data out. If you can’t get the data out in the first place, you can’t do anything.”However, the next name on this list is a little surprising to all the experts and professionals. Second highest in the list of PPYL Popularity of Programming Language Index, Python is the real winner in programming. For you to make your space in this big data realm, you ought to have in-depth understanding and hands-on preparation for Python and its toolkit. It is indeed the third critical finesse for the upcoming jobs in data science this year.This may have come up due to the fact that Python toolkit is getting better and releasing more advanced ways of working in Python environment. It also indicates that Data Science is not just about analytics and statistics, it is a lot more into programming.Next in the row are Java and R Programming. Java certainly is ubiquitous. No matter how much we prosper in technology, Java will continue to be a great programming language for most tools and platforms. It plays a prominent role in the life of Developers, Project Managers, Hadoopers, Mobile App Developers and many other IT and business aspirants. In reality, Java does not make much sense when it comes to Data Science in particular, but since Hadoop shows its prominence, we can’t ignore Java.","Answered Jul 23, 2016",1,,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-NCR/answers/25530682,1,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-NCR,1.0

Seeing this there are many institutes offering data science courses online like Udemy, Coursera, Simplilearn etc. that you can join.All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. Data Science is one such profession where you need to have classroom experience as well. You can choose online training for the basics but you have to undergo classroom training for the advance part of it.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program over a course. As programme is more purpose focused enlightening complete domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused where you can only upgrade limited number of skills. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence you going for a program would be recommendable.One should always go for a program which is onsite, instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an programEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAlso your program should ideally include the topics mentioned below in order to deliver a complete package.Basics of R & Python programmingExploratory Data Analysis with Excel, RLinear Regression, its variations and Industry ProjectDecision Trees, Ensemble & ClassificationClusteringTime Series RegressionData Bases & Big Data EcosystemData Visualization, story telling, dashboarding, TableauBuilding production scale data science products and their deploymentBig Data Engineering, Deep Learning & Tensor Flow, NLPDisclaimer: I am a co-founder @GreyAtom and assist engineering talents kickstart their career in emerging technologies.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career.

Here are some points which will help you find the best institute. For each of those points rank the institutes you research out of 10 points, total it up and then the highest point getter is your best institute:High quality faculty: Would you learn from someone who is a university prof and has never worked in the industry and hence doesn’t know the practical applications? Or would you learn from someone who has just completed a course and for want of anything else to do has started teaching? Or would you learn from someone who probably has less than a years worth of experience? Or would you rather learn from data scientists who have spent at least 3 years in the industry, worked on multiple business problems from different domains, faced various tricky situations and know the tips and tricks which when taught to you would enable you to be a cut above the rest?You will find institutes with each of such kind of faculty and your answer should be obvious. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Also why have I rated this factor higher than jobs or placements. That’s because while an institute may or may not succeed in getting you a job, if you are trained well then you yourself will find a job on your own.2. High quality curriculum: How good is the curriculum in terms of the coverage of the field? Does it cover all the requirements of the industry to help you be effective in interviews? Does it start from the basics and properly cover them, if you are a newbie? Is the course duration sufficient to cover all the topics effectively or is it too short or long?There are many institutes providing you courses which are between 20 hours and 300 hours. Some will just provide an overview of the topics while others will unnecessarily elongate everything and add in pointless topics so as to charge you more money under the guise of a university diploma. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Remember higher the no. of hours or more the modules doesn’t mean its a good curriculum. Again better the curriculum, better your learning and better your chances of a job.3. Practical content: How can you rate content when you don’t have access to it? What you have to do is look at the practical aspects of the curriculum. Figure out whether each of the modules are explained using practical examples or not? Ask how many case studies and assignments are there? Check if those case studies are reasonably good enough to help you understand the module. Don’t bother about size of data etc. as that’s meaningless. Check how many projects do you get to work on? These projects are important because that’s what you will eventually put on your CV to get a job. So these projects should be good and possibly from different domains.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Again more practical the content, better your learning and better your chances of a job.4. Support: Is there anyone working full-time in the institute who can help resolve your doubts outside the class, as the faculty maybe a working professional with no time during non-class days? How good is the support and how many different channels of support are available? Apart from this you need to figure out how flexible is the institute with regards to your issues. Do they allow you to transfer batches if you can’t continue in your current one? Do they allow you to extend any submission deadlines as you maybe a busy working professional?On the whole how supportive are they of you having a comfortable and good learning experience. Checking past reviews would help here. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Better the support, better your learning and better your chances of a job.5. Reviews: How good are the reviews for the institute so far? Yes, reviews on websites would obviously be good but check third party reviews like Google reviews for instance to see what other students have felt in the past. Look at the ratio of negative to positive reviews.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Lower the negative to positive review ratio, better the institute.6. Certification: Many of you may feel that this a very important criteria. However as far as certifications go, data science employers are not that concerned. You will hardly find any job description which asks for a particular institute certification. All they are looking for is hands-on project work.Yes a good certificate will help your resume stand-out but what kind of certificate? For a certificate to stand-out on your resume. it has to be something rare and hard to get. Just like an IIT stands out on the resume vs. a local engineering college, similarly the certificate is something which should be hard to get. Hence certificates from Coursera, Edx, Udemy etc. just won’t count as tens of thousands will have one. Corporate tie-ups for a certification are even more useless because if that particular corporate doesn’t hire you, then no one else would.Instead to gauge the value of an institute’s certificate you should look at the no. of company association’s it has in terms of training or certifying company employees. More and better the companies which the institute has trained better its certificate would be in getting you a job. This does get a bit complex though as many institutes would just put up a list of companies without having any associations with them.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points as there’s no way you can really know the truth.7. Jobs and placements: No institute on earth including the top universities of the world would give you any kind of placement guarantee’s. So let’s get that out of the way. Think like the grown-up that you are and realise that getting a job at this career stage is 80% in your hands and 20% in the institute’s. Yes, many institute’s will assert that they have 100% placements etc. and some will even say “100% placement assistance” or “100% placement support” in a bid to make it look as if they provide jobs to everyone whereas all they are going to do is provide assistance of some sort.Don’t bother asking for placement records as you will only end up with a random statistic. Instead what you need to see is how well they can assist you in getting a job because face it getting a job is in your hands. See if they will help you with creating a good resume, preparing for interviews and the kind of opportunities and companies that come to them looking to hire. Check the success stories of their students and talk to those people. Check the third party reviews.If any institute ever talks about giving you guaranteed placements, take it in writing from them with all the relevant terms and conditions along with the companies, roles and salaries offered. If the same is refused or offered partially don’t believe them. Also get a money-back guarantee in writing if they fail to place you.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points.8. Fees or value for money: Eventually fees will matter though the amount should not be the criteria. Of course your paying or borrowing capacity will eventually decide which institute you select but remember just because an institute is cheap doesn’t mean that is what you should select. The criteria should be where you are getting your bang for the buck. Where on the above criteria do you get the most value for the fee you have to pay is what should help you decide.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points.So there you are, 100 points across 8 areas to rank your institutes under consideration on.Areas which you should not bother about are:Online vs. Classroom: Seriously just don’t worry about this aspect. I know some of you may disagree with me but having run both online and classroom programs, I know that the learning experience is not at all different. In fact online works way better because of better faculty from around the world, more flexibility and ability to revisit classes through videos.External Rankings: External rankings will keep changing based on different criteria and the ranking agency’s methods. Instead create your own through your research and based on what is important for you.Now that you know what to evaluate on, why not evaluate Edvancer (Analytics Training -Business Analytics, Big Data, Data Science) on these criteria and see if we rank anywhere in your best institute list.","Answered May 19, 2018 · Author has 57 answers and 236.4k answer views",0,", works at Edvancer Eduventures",https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-Bangalore/answers/84007816,14,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-Bangalore,5.0

66,"Data science is the study of where information comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies. Mining large amounts of structured and unstructured data to identify patterns can help an organization rein in costs, increase efficiencies, recognize new market opportunities and increase the organization's competitive advantage.The main advantage of enlisting data science in an organization is the empowerment and facilitation of decision-making. Organizations with data scientists can factor in quantifiable, data-based evidence into their business decisions. These data-driven decisions can ultimately lead to increased profitability and improved operational efficiency, business performance and workflows.In customer-facing organizations, data science helps identify and refine target audiences. Data science can also assist recruitment: Internal processing of applications and data-driven aptitude tests and games can help an organization's human resources team make quicker and more accurate selections during the hiring process.Data Science also known as data- driven science helps you to create models, methodologies, and algorithms that provide practical utility. Data science is also the practice of asking questions and finding solutions to unknown problems which in turn motivate business values. This process involves working with a set of existing data or defining the data all by you.Besant Technologies boasts of being the Data Science training institute in Bangalore.Email: info@besanttechnologies.comNo 2, Ground floor,29th Main Road, Kuvempu Nagar,BTM Layout 2nd Stage, Bangalore - 560 076Karnataka, IndiaLandmark - Next to OI Play School+91-762 494 1772 / 74","Answered May 16, 2018 · Author has 53 answers and 17.6k answer views",1,,https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Kevin-49,19,John Kevin,https://www.quora.com/Which-institute-is-best-for-data-science-course-in-Bangalore,5.0
67,"I introduce you to an ecosystem of data scientist and data science aspirants where you can give and take all the trends and practical knowledge of the same.The main objective of data science is to help solve complex business problems with the help of data. To be precise, if you don't work on real industry problems, you won’t be able to groom yourself as a successful data scientist.I would always recommend data science aspirants to go for a program which is classroom based , instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an institution/courseEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAnd in my opinion, Certifications are a proof that you have completed a course or a program and not a proof for what you have done. You must have read a lot of articles about educated unemployment or even come across some personal experiences wherein many students have masters degree but still are jobless!Why so?Well, because there is a huge skill gap between what industry wants and what’s in supply. Education system to a large extent has become a business game of just selling certificates. Therefore, it is not always necessary to rely on certifications. Theoretical information can be imparted easily. But what matters is the IMPLEMENTATION !We recently launched GreyAtom, an immersive learning program for engineers with our flagship program in Data Science. We are bringing classroom based learning with the strong online component to ensure the quality of the program. Why did we decide to start GreyAtom?Problem with existing Eco-System in IndiaEngineering education is too theoretical. We waste 3 to 4 years to get a degree which hardly adds any industry knowledge. I faced the same situation 10 years back when I graduated — Unfortunately, it’s still the same.Most of the Private Institutes are in the business of selling certification. They pick buzz words like Data Science, Digital Marketing etc. and make money in the name of certification.Most of the engineers are still away from real industry tools and practices (test driven development, code versioning, pair programming, working with cloud etc).We still follow rules like — you need 60% aggregate to participate in campus placement. Because of such rules, students are crazy to score percentage rather than gaining some real knowledge.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education — We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program. Our focus is on building stuff and NOT CERTIFICATION.Focus on Industry Readiness — Our focus is on making our students industry ready. Our training platform “Commit.live” helps students build their profile on relevant platforms (GitHub, StackOverflow, Tech Blog) which are far more valuable than any certifications.Real Office Environment — We want to go away from classic “Coaching Institute” mentality. We want to mimic real industry experience throughout the program. Students will be working in an office environment.Quality EcoSystem — Our program is designed by the mix of industry practitioners and academician. All our instructors are people with hands-on experience and who have built some kick-ass stuff. We have an interview process before we enroll a student. Idea is to build qualitative ecosystem of experts and enthusiasts.Our Data Science ProgramWe have a separate track for freshers and working professionals. For freshers, there is a significant pre-work required before the start of the program.We have designed our program by interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. We also take continuous feedback from our premium community of data scientists (www.meetup.com/DataGiri/) which is now 4000 members strong.We already have some great industry partners on board with some really cool problem statements. Please visit an industry project section on our program page to get more details — Full Stack Data Science Engineering | GreyatomWe want to ensure that you should be able to write production-grade data science applications by end of the program. We cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.For the fact, India produces the highest number of engineering in the world and over 80% of them are unemployable. We are here to change that.Just to conclude, do not think GreyAtom as any other course, that’s not what we are trying to build. It’s an eco-system which helps improve industry readiness and quality of engineers.Disclaimer: I am a co-founder @GreyAtom, assisting engineering talents find sustainable careers in emerging technologies.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career. Students built projects upon REAL DataSet and Problem Statements provided by our industry and hiring partners. Program is classroom based and heavily practice driven.

71,"Data science, sometimes called Data analytics because it involves the handling and manipulation of a voluminous amount of data to decipher trends and patterns, is fast becoming of the the most sought-after professions of the new millenium. And rightly so because there is a staggering amount of data out there and an acute shortage of skilled professionals to deal with it. By way of a formal definition, Data science can be said to be a multidisciplinary platform of data inference, algorithm development, and employing technology to solve analytically complex problems.

104,"Hi,I am glad that you’re choosing one of the most booming careers in technology - Finance Programs. You can opt online or classroom training at Imarticus Learning in Delhi.All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. You can choose online training for the basics but you have to undergo classroom training for the advance part of it.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program over a course. As program is more purpose focused enlightening complete domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused where you can only upgrade limited number of skills. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence you going for a program would be recommendable.One should always go for a program which is onsite, instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn Finance. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Imarticus help aspirants like you to upgrade yourself and kick-start a career in Finance.Extensive projects, case studies & mentorship are a few highlights of our courses, since we believe in “Learning by doing”, which has won us various esteemed awards in the industry.If you wish to excel in a career in finance, you may feel free to consider any of our courses.

112,"Pertaining to Data Science training in pune, if one has to succeed, master the concepts and crack the job, following factors are important. At ExcelR, they ensure that learning is blended with these differentiators. It’s a lengthy answer I gave, but worth taking the effort as one should choose a right learning partner as it’s a significant career changing decision1) Good Faculty with hands on experience2) Course Curriculum3) E-learning videos to recap the concepts4) Assignments5) Projects6) Blended Training Model7) Accessibility to contact faculty8) Post Training support9) Placement Assistance10) Peer support11) Feedback from past participants12) Cost effective course fee13) International Certification14) Access to the complementary coursesGood Faculty with Hand on Experience:Faculty is our forte. All our trainers are working as Data Scientists in various top notch multinational organizations with over 15+ years professional experience. They carry excellent technical and domain knowledge and considered to be the best in the industry. Majority of the trainers are alumni of premier institutes such as IIT, IIM, Indian School of Business (ISB) and a few hold Ph.D qualification.At ExcelR, we hand pick the trainers subsequent to a thorough evaluation of knowledge, presentation skills, experience and passion for training. No wonder that our trainers are considered to be the best in the industry. We have in-house trainers who will ensure accessibility all throughout the training. Testimonials/Reviews given by our students endorse about the quality of our trainers and training. With a clause which says 70% of the time our trainers have to work on projects and 30% of their time they have to deliver trainings, participants can be rest assured about the real-life practical exposure along-side theory.Course Curriculum:Agenda is another key factor that needs to be considered in any training. Our Data Science course curriculum has been tailored to the needs of the industry. At ExcelR, we do a thorough research on the changing needs of the industry. We collate the topics in demand from our participants who secured jobs, working Data Scientists, industry stalwarts in Data Science and the organizations pertaining to various domains. On an average, we refine the agenda a minimum of 3 times a year with latest topics.ExcelR’s course agenda covers the entire data lifecycle starting from extraction of data, cleansing, structuring, Data Mining (Data Analysis), Forecasting and reporting. Our course starts with Basic Statistics (is a must for every participant as knowledge of basic statistics is required to master the advanced concepts) and topics such as Hypothesis testing, Regression Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Data Mining/Machine Learning, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Forecasting, Data Visualization, Deep Learning, Big Data Hadoop, Spark, etc., will be covered extensively.Tools covered as part of the training are R & R studio, Python, NodeXL, XLMiner, Minitab and Tableau.We cover every topic that is required, to land you in a job in a short period of time.E-learning Videos to Recap the Concepts:At ExcelR, we provide you with the complete course videos on all topics in the agenda recorded from renowned Data Scientist from ISB. Participants can watch the video before, during and after the training which helps to revise and recap the concepts. In addition to this, every virtual live online session will be recorded and shared on our Learning Management System (LMS). Participants can use the recorded sessions to recap or to watch the missed classes.Demo Session:Assignments:ExcelR provides 60+ assignments for practicing the theoretical concepts. Getting your hands dirty is key to master the concepts. With every concept that is taught, a related assignment will be given to ensure hands on experience. We have a separate SME team to help with your assignments, evaluate and give the feedback. All the assignments are devised to include the real-world challenges in dealing with data so that you are market ready and fair exceptionally well in interviews.Projects:ExcelR has myriad live projects to work upon. Participants should work on 2 Live projects chosen by them on the domain of their choice. This helps the participants to gain the big picture, simulating the live analytics projects lifecycle. This live project exposure happens through ExcelR’s analytics consulting vertical, Innodatatics, which is a USA based firm. You get a chance to work alongside our team of data scientists. This is going to provide the actual exposure you are looking out for before facing any data science interview.Blended Training Model:Data science is relatively a complex subject. Attending a classroom or online training may not be sufficient to absorb and assimilate the concepts. So, we devised a blended model of learning. In this model, participants avail themselves classroom, live online and e-learning (recorded sessions) with a single enrollment. A combination of these 3 will produce a synergistic impact on the learning. One can attend multiple Live online sessions from different trainers at no additional cost.Accessibility to Contact Faculty:All throughout the training and post training period, one trainer will be given as your mentor who does the required hand holding. Trainer can be contacted through phone / WhatsApp for any doubts clarification or necessary guidance. Trainer also helps you by providing guidance on strengthening your weakness so that you outshine and outsmart the moment you attend the interview.Post Training Support:Post training support is key to procure a job for any technology. As mentioned earlier, a dedicated trainer will be given as mentor. Project support, WhatsApp support will ensure that participants master the concepts without any hassles. Daily interview questions will be posted so that your interview preparation start right from day one. These questions are composed by our trainers based on their experience and based on the interaction with the participants who attended interviews and got jobs in data science.Placement Assistance:Subsequent to the completion of training, assignments and projects placement assistance will kick start. Help will be rendered in terms of resume building, FAQs for the interviews, one-to-one discussion on job description during interview calls, etc. A couple of mock interviews (one on one / telephonic) will be conducted by the SMEs to evaluate the grey areas and areas of strength. This helps the participant to retrospect and understand their interview readiness. Participant can attend and successfully crack the interviews with complete confidence.ExcelR has tied up with myriad IT companies to supply the resources in the space of Analytics. Subsequent to a thorough preparation, interviews will be facilitated with our partner IT companies.These are a few reasons of ExcelR’s high placement record in the industry.Peer Support:We ensure that past participants from ExcelR who secured jobs in the space of Data Science will help the current participants who are undergoing the training. They share their experiences and also provide guidance to fellow participants, which helps the participants with their preparation.Feedback from Past Participants:One may feel that we boast about ourselves about our training, but the reviews and feedback from participants will give the true picture about our quality and care. Check our Google reviews which endorses us.Affordable Course Fee:One can compare the agenda/facilities against the course fee we provide with other training providers. We challenge that no others can beat us. The takeaway one would get for the price is no way comparable in the industry. If you can find someone who can match us we give your money back. No questions asked because we believe in providing value for money.International Certification:ExcelR has tied up with UNIMAS university (UNIVERSTI MALAYSIA SARAWAK), Malaysia. Participants would get the certificate from the university of UNIMAS subsequent to exam and project submission. UNIMAS is the university owned by Government of Malaysia and is ranking in the top 200 universities in Asia.Access to complementary courses:Participants will be given complimentary access to e-learning courses like Big Data Hadoop, Core Python, Tableau and Webinars on latest happenings, etc. This will help to cross skill on various skillsets which overlap with Data Science domain.","Answered Aug 24, 2018",1,", former Digital Marketing & Data Science Expert",https://www.quora.com/profile/Raghu-Gaddam-4,3,Raghu Gaddam,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-Pune,11.0

But mba in business analytics is not compulsory stuff, u can easily go for online courses from fab classes like simplilearn, jigsaw academy, edureka etc but in online mode u need to be very much self motivated and inspired by yourself as it is virtual mode so efforts put must be 10–15% more than offline modes, but if it is done in great passion it is by far best in cheap rate as well as u will get it in short span of period.Job scenerio:- Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional. Freshers might find tough to into analytics space so better is gain experience for 2-3yrs side by side start your learning and after some years, go for interview and Get into your analytics life.Salary as per analytics india magazine is as follows:-0-4years experienced folks with all knowledge of r, python, excel can earn upto 10-12lacs that too from big shot mncs whereas startups will give u around 5-8lacs depending upon the nature and status of the startup.Learning methodology:- It hardly takes 6months of practice with weekly commitment of around 4-5hrs is enough to atleast cover all big data analytics concepts like Hadoop, hbase, hive, sqoop, spark, pig, mapreduce, scala, Cassandra, mongodb, storm, kafka written in java or python... But actual used tools in major companies are Hadoop(getting obsolete because of top class spark which is same as Hadoop only reliability, speed, one to two concepts differs), Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, Pig,Hdfs, Mapreduce.Note:- Tools differs but Concepts are majorly drawn from old ones. Easy to learn Any tools but Getting handson on concepts and realizing the actual working of the concepts plays a vital role in analytics domain.I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets.Coming to the courses mentioning below check it:-There are many other options which are having less fees, quality education, rich content as per latest market scenerio.Websites like KAGGLE, AIM & AVIDHYA will help.Best business schools in analytics space in asia as per many sources :-(colleges must be accredited with government as well as it must be facilitated by industry experts even for a certificate course)Praxis business school(backed by icici and pwc experts) Great full time and online mode classesIIM-C + ISI-C + IIT-K(Immensely Best in all terms)..

Though the application of data science was existing in many more years ago and limited to few industries but now its experimented across all most all the industries. Industries which predominately using are digital marketing, online shopping, retail, health care, finance, automobile, IOT etc.The rapid growth of data science is due to rapid technological innovation in the areas of bigdata technologies.Now we can capture any sort of data say its structured, unstructured or semi structured.We can store any size of data say its terabytes or petabytes.We can process data in any speed, we have technology and mechanism which can help us to process any amount of data in fractions of second.Data is a piece of information, if we start storing it, it becomes historical data. Imagine if we store about our own data. It will tell us about who we are. The same data can be used to find our life style pattern, our eating behavior, our socializing behavior, our buying/purchase behavior and lot many.Each one of these patterns can be used to solve some problems.For example:-· I can use my eating behavior pattern and predict whether I’ll be having any chance of getting obesity.· My purchase behavior pattern can be used to predict whether I can be a loyal costumer to a retail marketer/Shopping mall/Brand showroom.· My socialization behavior can be used to predict whether I’ll be suffering from depression or not.Hope these examples are able to explain importance of data and data science in our day to day life.If someone have inclination towards becoming a data analyst or a data scientist, then here are the list of technologies and techniques need to be learned to try out such job profiles.Fundamentals of Math and Probability Descriptive & Inferential Statistics  Predictive modeling such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression Decision Trees, boosting, Bagging techniques, Random Forest, Forecasting.Machine learning model like Bayes classifier, SVM, KNN.Neural network models like ANN, CNN, RNN etc.  Text analytics techniques such as NLP.Story telling and Visualization through Tableau/SpotfireWe also need to know following data quality checks.· Missing value imputation.· Outlier treatment.· Feature selection.· Unbalance data handling.· Many moreWe need to ensure that model which is build, it is making sense in terms of prediction accuracy, so we need to proof through statistical methods.We may need to do following Stat test.· T- Test, Paired T -test· F -Test· P – Test· Chi-square test· Many moreModel validation through error checks· MAPE score· Mean square error· Residual mean square error· R^2· Specificity/Sensitivity score· Many moreApart from all above studies, we need to spend many more hours to build domain knowledge.I’ve made up my mind and came across an institute Live Data Science Training.

Everything they do is data driven from their search engine ex:(google.com,Ask.com,Aol.com), through their YouTube efforts, maximization of ad revenue, etc. Google is not the best place to work just by chance.Indeed, even their HR group is utilizing the logical strategy to assess systems that improve the representatives feel at work so they can be more gainful.Amazon: Every item Recommendations that you get originates from Amazon's advanced information science calculations(amazon's data science algorithms). As a matter of fact, Amazon has executed a calculation that can predict with some sureness on the off chance that you will purchase a specific item. On the off chance that the likelihood is sufficiently high, they move it to the capacity unit nearest to you so when you really buy it, it could be delivered that day.Facebook: Facebook is generating ad revenue like crazy since it has all that personal data for all its users. Since you interact with the platform, they know if you prefer cat videos or dog videos, so they know if you are a cat person or a dog person. They know what sports you are into, what food you prefer, the amount of money that you are willing to spend online. In this way, they can target their users in extraordinary ways, thus companies just love to use it as a medium.That being said, not only huge companies have a data science division. Small businesses, blogs, local businesses,etc. use Google analytics for their needs and have seen huge gains from it. This is also a part of data science.

217,"The answer depends on which aspect of data you would like to work. One one hand, as it is already mentioned you have MBA schools like S P Jain, who specialises on markets and to my knowledge, expensive. At the same time, if you just wish for a certification, go to NSE (National Stock Exchange) webpage and you can choose the certification you wish. Unlike S P Jain, these are just certifications and do not offer placement opportunities. But to my knowledge, recruiters are also asking for NCFM certification of specific fields. You can travel a bit, Bangalore has institutes which technically assist you on softwares  dealing with just ""data"", rather on specific market. At the same time, if you are rigid of your location and wish to go for economic aspect of analysis, you can apply for the M.Sc program at IGIDR Mumbai (which specialises on economics and market); and this institute is directly under Reserve Bank of India. I have done my masters from IGIDR and it is one of the best place for learning analytics, and yes, IGIDR provide amazing placement opportunities, they place even better than MBA schools. If you are just concerned with data science and not application of data science then go for courses online like time series analysis, panel data analysis, cross-sectional analysis. A proper place to take online courses are coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/m... ). I believe it is under Stanford University, but you need a lot of dedication for that.Last but not the least, I must tell you that Bid Data Science has a lot of demand these days; may be this is the reason why people are hunting after these courses. At the same time, one must not forget that data is just a representation of population, they are merely numbers and do not make sense unless they are arranged and applied into use. They are tools but even tools differ for different purpose.  You need to know which kind of field you are interested in. Softwares and specialisations will also change accordingly. For example, stock market and money market necessarily require usage of time series model; applying a cross-sectional model makes no sense. Since each of these modelling are tough and time taking, first you need to be sure of what kind of population you choose to work on. Then select a course accordingly.

218,"I would always recommend data science aspirants to go for a program which is classroom based , instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an institution/courseEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAnd in my opinion, Certifications are a proof that you have completed a course or a program and not a proof for what you have done. You must have read a lot of articles about educated unemployment or even come across some personal experiences wherein many students have masters degree but still are jobless!Why so?Well, because there is a huge skill gap between what industry wants and what’s in supply. Education system to a large extent has become a business game of just selling certificates. Therefore, it is not always necessary to rely on certifications. Theoretical information can be imparted easily. But what matters is the IMPLEMENTATION !We recently launched GreyAtom, an immersive learning program for engineers with our flagship program in Data Science. We are bringing classroom based learning with the strong online component to ensure the quality of the program.Why did we decide to start GreyAtom?Problem with existing Eco-System in IndiaEngineering education is too theoretical. We waste 3 to 4 years to get a degree which hardly adds any industry knowledge. I faced the same situation 10 years back when I graduated — Unfortunately, it’s still the same.Most of the Private Institutes are in the business of selling certification. They pick buzz words like Data Science, Digital Marketing etc. and make money in the name of certification.Most of the engineers are still away from real industry tools and practices (test driven development, code versioning, pair programming, working with cloud etc).We still follow rules like — you need 60% aggregate to participate in campus placement. Because of such rules, students are crazy to score percentage rather than gaining some real knowledge.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education — We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program. Our focus is on building stuff and NOT CERTIFICATION.Focus on Industry Readiness — Our focus is on making our student’s industry ready. Our training platform “Commit.live” helps students build their profile on relevant platforms (GitHub, StackOverflow, Tech Blog) which are far more valuable than any certifications.Real Office Environment — We want to go away from classic “Coaching Institute” mentality. We want to mimic real industry experience throughout the program. Students will be working in an office environment.Quality EcoSystem — Our program is designed by the mix of industry practitioners and academician. All our instructors are people with hands-on experience and who have built some kick-ass stuff. We have an interview process before we enroll a student. Idea is to build qualitative ecosystem of experts and enthusiasts.Our Data Science ProgramWe have a separate track for freshers and working professionals. For freshers, there is a significant pre-work required before the start of the program.We have designed our program by interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. We also take continuous feedback from our premium community of data scientists (www.meetup.com/DataGiri/) which is now 4000 members strong.We already have some great industry partners on board with some really cool problem statements. Please visit an industry project section on our program page to get more details — Full Stack Data Science Engineering | GreyatomWe want to ensure that you should be able to write production-grade data science applications by end of the program. We cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.For the fact, India produces the highest number of engineering in the world and over 80% of them are unemployable. We are here to change that.Just to conclude, do not think GreyAtom as any other course, that’s not what we are trying to build. It’s an eco-system which helps improve industry readiness and quality of engineers.Disclaimer: I am a co-founder @GreyAtom, assisting engineering talents find sustainable careers in emerging technologies.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career.

219,"It’s no longer a question whether an association needs Big Data technique. It’s an issue of how soon they grasp it. IT experts are scrambling to get certified in Big Data or Hadoop, which is relied upon to end up basically the most heated tech-expertise in the following couple of years. Huge Data is gradually receiving noticeable interest known everywhere throughout the world, as organisations overall verticals like utilities, retail, media, pharmaceuticals, vitality, and others are grasping the most current IT idea. This is also the reason why Big Data training and certifications in big data have become so popular in the recent years.According to some current techniques, numerous association did not have the capacity to meet the requests of the client because of the unpredictability of information to break down and prepare the information. To dodge these sort of issues, Organisations are actualizing Big Data innovations. Overall areas of the world, 53% of the 1,217 organisations had embraced no less than one Big Data activity.Why Big Data Certification?The truth of the matter is, organisations are attempting to get Hadoop ability. Ventures embracing Hadoop need to be guaranteed that individuals they contract can deal with the petabytes of Big Data. The testament is a proof in such manner, making a man in charge of the information.The following happen to be the benefits of big data training, especially with Hadoop:Taking after are a portion of the regular points of interest Big Data affirmation offers.HR managers and HR groups are chasing for aspirants having big data and Hadoop certifications. It’s an unequivocally preferred standpoint over those having no affirmation.Huge information accreditation gives an edge over different experts, in regards to the compensation bundle.Hadoop, as well as big data certification, helps an individual quicken vocation development amid the inside employment posting process.One of the real points of interest Big Data certification gives is that it is useful for those attempting to change over to Hadoop from other specialised foundations.Hadoop certification underwrites hands-on understanding of working with Big Data.Confirms that an expert knows about the most recent Hadoop highlights.The big data certification helps in talking all the more unquestionably about the innovation to the organisation while organising with others.While the above are the general benefits of anyone who happens to have pursued a big data training or certification. The biggest benefit of all would most definitely be the salary packages that some of the expert Data scientists receive these days. As the world becomes increasingly data driven, organisations of various stature have begun to depend on these big data magicians, to create their magic with numbers and help their respective firm’s progress.Now for the important question. Where does a data aspirant go to get a certification in Big Data? Imarticus Learning happen to be the best in class, especially when it comes to certification in Big data courses that are thoroughly industry endorsed.The program includes comprehensive coverage of Big Data trends, HDFS architecture, MapReduce concepts, Query tools like Hive and Pig, data loading tools and several advanced Hadoop concepts, all taught by experienced industry professionals who have 15+ years of experience in this domain.Our program is aligned to meet the needs of the industry and the focus is always on job-readiness rather than being excessively academic.

221,"The obvious thing when you look at all the answers on this question is that they are all from various institutes promoting themselves as the best and not from any third party course takers. Should you believe those answers then? Instead ask yourself what exactly defines a “best institute” or an institute where you would like to learn. Here are some points which will help you find the best institute. For each of those points rank the institutes you research out of 10 points, total it up and then the highest point getter is your best institute:High quality faculty: Would you learn from someone who is a university prof and has never worked in the industry and hence doesn’t know the practical applications? Or would you learn from someone who has just completed a course and for want of anything else to do has started teaching? Or would you learn from someone who probably has less than a years worth of experience? Or would you rather learn from data scientists who have spent at least 3 years in the industry, worked on multiple business problems from different domains, faced various tricky situations and know the tips and tricks which when taught to you would enable you to be a cut above the rest?You will find institutes with each of such kind of faculty and your answer should be obvious. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Also why have I rated this factor higher than jobs or placements. That’s because while an institute may or may not succeed in getting you a job, if you are trained well then you yourself will find a job on your own.2. High quality curriculum: How good is the curriculum in terms of the coverage of the field? Does it cover all the requirements of the industry to help you be effective in interviews? Does it start from the basics and properly cover them, if you are a newbie? Is the course duration sufficient to cover all the topics effectively or is it too short or long?There are many institutes providing you courses which are between 20 hours and 300 hours. Some will just provide an overview of the topics while others will unnecessarily elongate everything and add in pointless topics so as to charge you more money under the guise of a university diploma. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Remember higher the no. of hours or more the modules doesn’t mean its a good curriculum. Again better the curriculum, better your learning and better your chances of a job.3. Practical content: How can you rate content when you don’t have access to it? What you have to do is look at the practical aspects of the curriculum. Figure out whether each of the modules are explained using practical examples or not? Ask how many case studies and assignments are there? Check if those case studies are reasonably good enough to help you understand the module. Don’t bother about size of data etc. as that’s meaningless. Check how many projects do you get to work on? These projects are important because that’s what you will eventually put on your CV to get a job. So these projects should be good and possibly from different domains.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points. Again more practical the content, better your learning and better your chances of a job.4. Support: Is there anyone working full-time in the institute who can help resolve your doubts outside the class, as the faculty maybe a working professional with no time during non-class days? How good is the support and how many different channels of support are available? Apart from this you need to figure out how flexible is the institute with regards to your issues. Do they allow you to transfer batches if you can’t continue in your current one? Do they allow you to extend any submission deadlines as you maybe a busy working professional?On the whole how supportive are they of you having a comfortable and good learning experience. Checking past reviews would help here. Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Better the support, better your learning and better your chances of a job.5. Reviews: How good are the reviews for the institute so far? Yes, reviews on websites would obviously be good but check third party reviews like Google reviews for instance to see what other students have felt in the past. Look at the ratio of negative to positive reviews.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points. Lower the negative to positive review ratio, better the institute.6. Certification: Many of you may feel that this a very important criteria. However as far as certifications go, data science employers are not that concerned. You will hardly find any job description which asks for a particular institute certification. All they are looking for is hands-on project work.Yes a good certificate will help your resume stand-out but what kind of certificate? For a certificate to stand-out on your resume. it has to be something rare and hard to get. Just like an IIT stands out on the resume vs. a local engineering college, similarly the certificate is something which should be hard to get. Hence certificates from Coursera, Edx, Udemy etc. just won’t count as tens of thousands will have one. Corporate tie-ups for a certification are even more useless because if that particular corporate doesn’t hire you, then no one else would.Instead to gauge the value of an institute’s certificate you should look at the no. of company association’s it has in terms of training or certifying company employees. More and better the companies which the institute has trained better its certificate would be in getting you a job. This does get a bit complex though as many institutes would just put up a list of companies without having any associations with them.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points as there’s no way you can really know the truth.7. Jobs and placements: No institute on earth including the top universities of the world would give you any kind of placement guarantee’s. So let’s get that out of the way. Think like the grown-up that you are and realise that getting a job at this career stage is 80% in your hands and 20% in the institute’s. Yes, many institute’s will assert that they have 100% placements etc. and some will even say “100% placement assistance” or “100% placement support” in a bid to make it look as if they provide jobs to everyone whereas all they are going to do is provide assistance of some sort.Don’t bother asking for placement records as you will only end up with a random statistic. Instead what you need to see is how well they can assist you in getting a job because face it getting a job is in your hands. See if they will help you with creating a good resume, preparing for interviews and the kind of opportunities and companies that come to them looking to hire. Check the success stories of their students and talk to those people. Check the third party reviews.If any institute ever talks about giving you guaranteed placements, take it in writing from them with all the relevant terms and conditions along with the companies, roles and salaries offered. If the same is refused or offered partially don’t believe them. Also get a money-back guarantee in writing if they fail to place you.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 10 points.8. Fees or value for money: Eventually fees will matter though the amount should not be the criteria. Of course your paying or borrowing capacity will eventually decide which institute you select but remember just because an institute is cheap doesn’t mean that is what you should select. The criteria should be where you are getting your bang for the buck. Where on the above criteria do you get the most value for the fee you have to pay is what should help you decide.Rate each of your institutes under consideration on this parameter out of 15 points.So there you are, 100 points across 8 areas to rank your institutes under consideration on.Areas which you should not bother about are:Online vs. Classroom: Seriously just don’t worry about this aspect. I know some of you may disagree with me but having run both online and classroom programs, I know that the learning experience is not at all different. In fact online works way better because of better faculty from around the world, more flexibility and ability to revisit classes through videos.External Rankings: External rankings will keep changing based on different criteria and the ranking agency’s methods. Instead create your own through your research and based on what is important for you.Now that you know what to evaluate on, why not evaluate Edvancer (Analytics Training -Business Analytics, Big Data, Data Science) on these criteria and see if we rank anywhere in your best institute list.","Updated Jan 23, 2018 · Author has 57 answers and 236.4k answer views",1,", works at Edvancer Eduventures",https://www.quora.com/What-is-best-institute-in-Mumbai-to-do-Data-science-and-big-data-certification/answers/16461687,4,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/What-is-best-institute-in-Mumbai-to-do-Data-science-and-big-data-certification,21.0

Its size is in the multi terabytes.Big Data is classified in terms of:Volume – Today data size has increased to size of terabytes in the form of records or transactionsVariety – There is huge variety of data based on internal, external, behavioral, or/and social type. Data can be of structured, semi structured or unstructured type.Velocity – It means near or real-time assimilation of data coming in huge volume.For more detail refer below link:Big Data tutorialYou can watch below video for Big Data:Watch below video to get an answer that Why we should learn Big data:Now let’s move toward Hadoop. What is Hadoop and why Hadoop is so popular and how hadoop provided the solution to it, How Hadoop works etc etc..So, let’s start with Hadoop introduction:HADOOPHadoop is used for processing and storing large volume of data. It effieciently stores massive amount of data. It stores data in any form like structure, unstructured and semistructured. It stores data in HDFS.Watch below video for soft introduction of Hadoop:How Hadoop provided the solutionEarlier we were using an RDBMS. By using traditional method we were not able to store huge amount of data. Today we are generating data in huge amount but earlier data were not generated like now so we were storing data in RDBMS efficiently. As the data size increases, we started getting problem in storing then Hadoop emerged as a solution to Big data.The Second problem was that RDBMS only stores data in the structured form which is its major drawback, but today the 80% of data generation is unstructured. Hadoop stores all types of data that’s why we say that Hadoop is flexible.For more detail refer below link:Hadoop guideAfter Hadoop Introduction learn MapReduce and HDFS.MapReduce is the heart of Hadoop. It is processing layer of Hadoop. The programming part is done in mapper and reducer.For kore detail of Mapreduce refer below links:MapReduce Comprehensive GuideMapReduce MapperMapReduce ReducerYou can also watch below video for MapReduce:Now let’s learn HDFS.HDFS is a storage layer of Hadoop. Apache Hadoop HDFS is a distributed file system which provides redundant storage space for storing files which are huge in sizes; files which are in the range of Terabytes and Petabytes. In HDFS data is stored reliably.For more detail about HDFS refer below link:HDFS comprehensive guideNow let’s see that How Hadoop works.Let us understand functioning of Hadoop.To process any data, client submits data and program. Data is stored using HDFS while processing of data is done using Map-Reduce.Let us now see how data is stored in Hadoop.As we know, HDFS is the storing element of Hadoop. There are 2 daemons that run for HDFS:Namenode run on master node while datanode runs on slaves.Namenode daemon stores the metadata while datanode daemons store the actual data.The data is broken into small chunks called as blocks and these blocks are stored distributedly on different nodes in the cluster. Each block is replicated as per the replication factor (By default 3).To know more detail answer refer below link:How Hadoop worksHope that it helps","Answered Aug 25, 2017 · Author has 69 answers and 95.2k answer views",1,", Research Analyst at DataFlair",https://www.quora.com/profile/Maya-Singh-71,0,Maya Singh,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-best-institute-for-big-data,25.0

253,"Hi friends,My suggestion is Greens Technologys, the best Big Data training institute in chennai. Big data is often characterized by 3Vs: the extreme volume of data, the wide variety of data types and the velocity at which the data must be processed. Although big data doesn't equate to any specific volume of data, the term is often used to describe terabytes, petabytes and even exabytes of data captured over time.While the term “big data” is relatively new, the act of gathering and storing large amounts of information for eventual analysis is ages old. The concept gained momentum in the early 2000s when industry analyst Doug Laney articulated the now-mainstream definition of big data as the three Vs:Volume. Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, social media and information from sensor or machine-to-machine data. In the past, storing it would’ve been a problem – but new technologies (such as Hadoop) have eased the burden.Velocity. Data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the need to deal with torrents of data in near-real time.Variety. Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, email, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial transactions.

257,"Big Data Hadoop is an open source framework, which organisations all over the world use to store data and run applications on clusters of commodity hardware. There is the facility to store any kind of data as it has massive storage capacity. It can also process huge data in no time. Furthermore, Hadoop can handle virtually unlimited concurrent tasks. With Hadoop no data is too big and in today’s hyper connected world where more and more data is being created every day Hadoop breakthrough advantages mean that businesses and organisations can now find value in data that was recently considered useless.Historical overviewBefore you jump into Big Data Hadoop training, let’s take a historical overview of it. As 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a boom in World Wide Web, search engines and indexes came into existence to help people find relevant results. In its earlier stages, the search results were mapped by the humans, but as the technology got sophisticated, everything became algorithmic. Web crawlers came into existence and many search engines like AltaVista, Yahoo, MSN etc. took off.Nutch an open-source web search engine was one of such projects. It was created by Dough Cutting and Mike Cafarella. The main motive of its creation was to return web search results faster with the help of distributing data and calculations via different computers so that to accomplish multiple tasks concurrently. In the mean time, Google was in the making too, which was based on the same theory.In 2006, Cutting became a part of Yahoo and kept working on Nutch project and ideas based on Google’s early task with automating distributed data storage as well as processing. The Nutch project had two parts- the web crawler part which remained as Nutch. Second the distributed computing as well as processing that became Hadoop (the mascot was taken from Cutting’s toy elephant). Hadoop was launched as an open-source project by Yahoo in 2008. Now, its framework and ecosystem of technologies are maintained by Apache Software Foundation- which is a universal community of software developers and contributors.Before you go for Hadoop certification, let’s understand why is it important?Hadoop has the ability to store as well as process bulks of data in any format. With data volumes going larger day by day with the evolution of social media, considering this technology is really, really important.Unmatched computing power: The distributed computing model of Hadoop processes big data in a fast pace. The more computing nodes, the more processing power.Effective fault tolerance: There is no need to panic in hardware failure as Hadoop has the facility to protect data and applications. In case a node fails, jobs are automatically redirected to other nodes hence no obstruction in distributed computing. It also stores multiple copies of data.Superb flexibility: There is no need to preprocess data before its storage just you used to do in conventional relational databases. You can store as much data as you want and use it later. Unstructured, text, images and videos can also be stored easily.Scalability: By adding nodes you can enhance your system to handle more data. There is no need to be a pro in system administration.Affordable: As the open source network is free, it uses commodity hardware for the storage of large data.Which Companies Hire Hadoop Professionals?As the industries are adapting big data as a solution to their unsolved data problems, big data analysis is going to be the next boom. Every section of an organization, like marketing, HR, and finance are having direct access to their data. This is bringing fresh job opportunities and organizations are looking for Hadoop professionals in all sections.Organizations all over the world are running behind customer analytics not because of the data re big but because of its potential. Online transactions, browsing history, social media posts and what not!Even demonetization in India has led to drastic usage of virtual data. Now banks are digitalizing, payments are going cashless and so on. All these denote the evolvement of virtual data more than ever in India. Demonetization has compelled every transaction go electronic; hence, there lies a vast, vast, vast opportunity for big data Hadoop professionals. Currently Citi Bank, Yes Bank and American Express are using this technology very aggressively while State bank Of India is planning to implement Hadoop Technology.According to a study by 2020, 80\% of all Fortune 500 companies will adapt to Hadoop, while 20\% will join the same bandwagon by watching the trend around.Here is a list of companies who already are using Hadoop and hire Hadoop professionals:FacebookLinkedInYahooTwitterRBSHCLUnited Health GroupAmazonSnapdealCiti BankInfosysAdobeAccentureAmerican ExpressCognizantImpetusYes Bank and moreFrom big companies to banks, etc almost every organisation is joining the bandwagon of big data Hadoop that’s opening up new avenues of Hadoop professionals.

Data drives the modern organizations of the world and hence making sense of this data and unravelling the various patterns and revealing unseen connections within the vast sea of data becomes critical and a hugely rewarding endeavour indeed. Better data leads to better decision making and an improved way to strategize for organizations regardless of their size, geography, market share, customer segmentation and such other categorizations. The most successful enterprises of tomorrow will be the ones that can make sense of all that data at extremely high volumes and speeds in order to capture newer markets and customer base.Big Data has certain characteristics and hence is defined using 4Vs namely:Volume: the amount of data that businesses can collect is really enormous and hence the volume of the data becomes a critical factor in Big Data analytics.Velocity: the rate at which new data is being generated all thanks to our dependence on the internet, sensors, machine-to-machine data is also important to parse Big Data in a timely manner.Variety:the data that is generated is completely heterogeneous in the sense that it could be in various formats like video, text, database, numeric, sensor dataand so on and hence understanding the type of Big Data is a key factor to unlocking its value.Veracity: knowing whether the data that is available is coming from a credible source is of utmost importance before deciphering and implementing Big Data for business needs.Here is a brief explanation of how exactly businesses are utilizing Big Data:Once the Big Data is converted into nuggets of information then it becomes pretty straightforward for most business enterprises in the sense that they now know what their customers want, what are the products that are fast moving, what are the expectations of the users from the customer service, how to speed up the time to market, ways to reduce costs, and methods to build economies of scale in a highly efficient manner. Thus Big Data distinctively leads to big time benefits for organizations and hence naturally there is such a huge amount of interest in it from all around the world.","Answered Sep 5, 2016",1,,https://www.quora.com/Big-data-engineer-training/answers/27416040,3,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/Big-data-engineer-training,26.0

283,"Rising alongside the relatively new technology of Big Data is the new job title data scientist. While not tied exclusively to Big Data projects, the data scientist role does complement them because of the increased breadth and depth of data being examined, as compared to traditional roles....You Can Visit This Link-:Big Data, Data Science - Combo Course Training Classes Online | Big Data, Data Science - Combo Course Courses Online A data scientist represents an evolution from the business or data analyst role. The formal training is similar, with a solid foundation typically in computer science and applications, modeling, statistics, analytics and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Good data scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization.The data scientist role has been described as “part analyst, part artist .“A data scientist is somebody who is inquisitive, who can stare at data and spot trends. It's almost like a Renaissance individual who really wants to learn and bring change to an organization.""Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources. The data scientist will sift through all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight, which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem. A data scientist does not simply collect and report on data, but also looks at it from many angles, determines what it means, then recommends ways to apply the data.Data scientists are inquisitive: exploring, asking questions, doing “what if” analysis, questioning existing assumptions and processesData is doubling every two years, and everyone has heard of the preposterous growth numbers stated in reports. Against this backdrop, the inevitable outcome is the emergence of the Data Scientist. A data scientist needs to analyze vast amounts of data and cast the technology map to make the transition of data to insights possible. The scope of the job of a data scientist includes identifying data sources, quality of data, correlations between data points and dissemination to the users of information.For the moment, the role of a data scientist is played by a combination of people in the BI team, such as the data warehouse architect, Business analyst, and others of that ilk. As the situation evolves, the data scientist would work above these professionals to unearth new trends and associations that may be beyond the realm of current models and Business problems. The Business analyst would work on the data that has been put together by the data scientist. James Kobielus, a senior analyst with Forrester, in his Business, goes as far as to compare the work of a data scientist with the work of scientists in the natural sciences and social sciences, stating that they would need observational data and experimental data to work with. “Historically (data scientists) have had to be content with mere examples.” With a full-fledged career emerging, this will soon change.Discussions on who exactly is qualified to be a data scientist do not vary too much from the debate held earlier on whether a Yet, at the outset, industry experts have indicated that a data scientist should have a master’s degree in mathematics or statistics. Meanwhile, , group CTO at Shoppers Stop, states, “There is a shortage of professionals who can be called data scientists. At the moment, whoever has a passion to work with data is filling the void.”A data scientist will work at developing new algorithms and bring forth new patterns and insights into the data that otherwise would stay hidden. “Along with statistics, a data scientist can have a qualification in economics, and most definitely needs a dozen or more years’ experience with working with ten to fifteen BI tools,” says Chuck Hollis, VP for global marketing & CTO, EMC.a provider of decision science and analytics services says “Data scientists will also dabble in experimental psychology, anthropology and social sciences.” With a need to establish BI centers of excellence (CoE), analytics will get institutionalized.With the advent of social media impacting most facets of business, organizations look forward to integrate technology, social software and BI to create a congenial decision making environment. The data scientist will be responsible for providing a social context to information. BI and analytics dance to a new tune when adopting new approaches such as Hadoop. They do not wait for structured, cleansed, pristine data but work with a mixed bag of data to provide real- or near time analysis. Descriptive analytics, inquisitive analytics, Predective and prescriptive analytics are all part of the new paradigm, with the data scientist at the center.The evolution curve is moving from decision support to becoming increasingly operational, with an imminent progression that will take strategic competence to a whole new level with data scientists in the picture. BI came on the scene fifteen years ago and IT owned these initiatives. Now, BI is a Business function involving market research with a central focus on analytics. Companies with large volumes of data (internal and external) would take to The Notion Market without batting an eyelid, but smaller companies would think twice before paying someone money to do something their BI vendor told them their BI product would do.However, it is not as if there are data scientists in abundance, all clamoring for jobs. On the contrary, as Hollis from EMC says, “There is a shortage of talent. For every data scientist out there, there are thirty jobs waiting.”In answer to this problem, Analytics as a Service presents itself as a feasible alternative. Analytics as a service is still nascent and evolving; as the complexity grows and mature service models that are linked to outcomes and success emerge, the adoption rate will increase. The possibility of Hiring a data Scientist through an analytics service provider is an intermediary step for many mid-sized and small BUSINESS","Answered Jul 25, 2016",2,,https://www.quora.com/What-is-big-data-science/answers/25602552,0,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/What-is-big-data-science,28.0

Candidates from background like statistics, Maths , economics and Computer science are most preferable than other but, yes there is no end of learning if you have interest in data scientist and you learnt all the skills related to that, plus have some projects on hand then nobody can stop you to become data scientist.For data scientist there is no specific degree required, but yes you must have best and trending technologies on your portfolio and some experience on hand as a practical knowledge to showcase your work to companies directly.There are a lot of new and trending technologies booming out in the industry and have a huge demand -Machine Learning - Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.Today’s very important application to learn before entering to industry and in IT sector.Python - Python is a interpreted, high-level programming language. Python allows programmers to use different programming styles to create simple or complex programs, get quicker results and write code almost as if speaking in a human language. Companies are looking for this language specifically.R - The R programming language is an open source scripting language for predictive analytics and data visualization.Tableau (Visualisation) - Tableau is the most powerful, secure, and flexible end-to-end analytics platform for your data. Tableau is the only business intelligence platform that turns your data into insights that drive action. That actually very helpful if you learn and then go for best opportunities because that is the must element companies will look forward from your side.How to succeed further if you are a science student !For you getting skills is not the only way to get good opportunities as data scientist, science student is not enough you need to have some practice on the programming language is must then only you can compete with people have coding skills. So for that you need to have some project on hand so that you have our own portfolio to show to the company. Projects help you to get experience on how to handle data, metric and insights to analyse the algorithms.Data scientists are required to work with huge amounts of data. A small mistake and mishandling of this data can lead to loss of millions, which is why companies prefer to hire experienced data scientist. Mostly it’s data analysts who with some experience and after learning additional skills become data scientists. Having projects on hand related to upgraded technologies are cream on cake for you, companies are looking for candidates having experience because there are very less opportunities for fresher as of now. Build your profile with best projects with in 3-4 months with your skills in trending technologies.There are a lot of online platforms from where you can learn these new technologies. Udacity, udemy, coursera,etc but you are really looking for getting experience also on hand for faster growth then i would suggest you to go for edWisor, because from here you can learn latest technologies to upgrade yourself to data scientist while working on live projects.

So one thing is for sure that Data Science is not a bubble that will burst in some time but it is going much more advanced and faster in the days to come. In this article you will find out what is this “data” and what is “data science” and what does it mean for you.Data science can be defined as a combination of various scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract insights from the large datasets (which is otherwise hidden). Since the rise of the Internet, there has been a constant spike in the rise of data, and the introduction of social media platforms like, facebook, twitter, instagram, etc. along with the advanced smart phones has contributed tremendously in the generation of data.

From people’s friends list, buying behaviour, pictures, what they like and what they dislike, their opinion about a particular thing or topic, etc. All these details (data) about individuals can be scientifically analysed and used in creating a better online environment. From suggesting the books, movies and videos they might like, or suggesting an item they might be interested in buying.An example would include, Netflix, it uses the data of millions of users regarding the movies and shows they have watched, the actors they like and the kind of movies they like.

308,"Too early to tell.Data science(s) is the current fad to work on in the computing sciences (along with various AI topics). This is because most of computer science has largely ignored data until recently. They assumed that data was the province of other fields, and they were trying to show mathematical generality in their field (that’s a generalization).Some of the problem comes from not only the lack of a handle on the things (work/services) people are trying to do, but also this is tightly controlled to science funding in general; other science and industry which is creating lots of data. This is the difficulty just talking about the topic.Before this, long before this, science had this distinction between theory and experiment. Experiment was the big difference which distinguished the theory from merely philosophy. Theory could be predictive (and forecasting and prediction was worth money, power, weapons, etc). This was/is quite Newtonian. And it got a real boost not only because of the calculus but because of the atomic bomb.So for decades, physics controls (still does) science funding. And this model of theory and experiment (trial and error, if you will) kind of worked OK, there were are border overlaps which caused a lot of head scratch, so a few people suggested a 3rd paradigm of computational science. I know a lot of the people who argued for that, but I’m not quite convinced. But I will argue for this for purposes of discussion. {A lot of people in the science funding community don’t like this 3rd paradigm issue (in fact, you find people who hate that word paradigm (popular because of Kuhn)).}Some couple of decades were necessary to gain some amount of financial respect to funding computing infrastructure with mixed success. Not without attempts to cut funding. Meanwhile, computers got better, cheaper, smaller, faster, etc. That helped the case for computational sciences (the applications of computers to science much less the study of computers (computer science)). During this time, because memory was expensive, data was largely ignored.A good example of this was the apparent recent (1990s) use of the word meta-data. People (users) knew about the importance of what was given the name meta-data, but other fields already knew of it’s importance but their fields largely weren't heard. They used similar sounding terms like “ancillary data.” Examples include topics like units. In fact, the original Unix operating system has a command for unit(1) conversion. In fact other work was done on units in programming languages back in the 1970s.Another set of areas of common data analysis came from graphics or statistics. In the stat case, there was a lot of emphasis placed on central tendencies like arithmetic (or geometric or harmonic) means, median, modes, extrema (max or mins), single-figures-of-merit, etc. And then averages of these averages (variance or standard deviation), so the usual CS curriculum typically included a probability & stat class. This was assumed to be enough. Ditto graphics which had a version of “visualization” come in.It was not simple enough to find data (data bases, indexing, data mining).So what’s information science? That’s an even older, vaguer term. Knowledge science? There has for decades been this pecking order of abstraction. Data is measured in the smallest units of bits (qubits if you want to deal with quantum machines). But what’s known is that data goes into information (which has no measure like a bit (maybe the qubits will be this)). And knowledge will be composed from information. . . . to Wisdom. Whatever that is.You can tie in other fields, but the bottom line is that it’s somewhat early to pass judgment.I’d close with a commonly forgot comment from Richard Hamming: the purpose of computing isn’t numbers, it’s insight. (whatever insight is.) And another scientist noted, the purpose of computing is not yet in sight.","Answered Nov 5, 2018 · Author has 9.1k answers and 6.7m answer views",0,", Journal Editor",https://www.quora.com/profile/Eugene-Miya,6,Eugene Miya,https://www.quora.com/Is-data-science-overrated,30.0

Hadoop Training & Big Data Online Certification training | IntellipaatHere are some real-world examples of Big Data in action:Consumer product companies and retail organizations are monitoring social media like Facebook and Twitter to get an unprecedented view into customer behavior, preferences, and product perception.Manufacturers are monitoring minute vibration data from their equipment, which changes slightly as it wears down, to predict the optimal time to replace or maintain. Replacing it too soon wastes money; replacing it too late triggers an expensive work stoppageManufacturers are also monitoring social networks, but with a different goal than marketers: They are using it to detect aftermarket support issues before a warranty failure becomes publicly detrimental.Financial Services organizations are using data mined from customer interactions to slice and dice their users into finely tuned segments. This enables these financial institutions to create increasingly relevant and sophisticated offers.Advertising and marketing agencies are tracking social media to understand responsiveness to campaigns, promotions, and other advertising mediums.Insurance companies are using Big Data analysis to see which home insurance applications can be immediately processed, and which ones need a validating in-person visit from an agent.By embracing social media, retail organizations are engaging brand advocates, changing the perception of brand antagonists, and even enabling enthusiastic customers to sell their products.Hospitals are analyzing medical data and patient records to predict those patients that are likely to seek readmission within a few months of discharge. The hospital can then intervene in hopes of preventing another costly hospital stay.Web-based businesses are developing information products that combine data gathered from customers to offer more appealing recommendations and more successful coupon programs.Sports teams are using data for tracking ticket sales and even for tracking team strategies.","Answered Jun 21, 2016",1,,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-Big-Data-Hadoop-training-institute-in-Pune/answers/24205192,0,Anonymous,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-Big-Data-Hadoop-training-institute-in-Pune,32.0

For learning Big Data Hadoop, you have to go through the sets of videos and blogsNow, first I will recommend that start learning from basics. If you have good understanding of basics, then you can learn complex part easily.I have good collections of blogs for Big Data Hadoop which helped me in learning Big Data Hadoop.So, let’s start with basics.Big DataAny piece of information can be considered as data.This data can be in various forms and in various sizes. It can vary from small data to very big Data. Extremely large sets of Data is called Big Data.Any data which cannot reside in Hard disk or in a single system is considered as Big Data. Its size is more than 1000s of GBs.For more detail: Big Data GuideIf you want to know the history of Big Data that how Big Data came into the picture, then click the below link.Big Data – HistoryHadoopHadoop is an open source tool from ASF. Open source means its codes are easily available and its framework is written in Java. It is used for distributed storage and processing of dataset of Big Data.For more details click the link: Hadoop Introduction GuideOnce you had done with introduction part, then move ahead with Hadoop main parts.HDFSMapReduceYarnHDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System)It is a part of Apache Hadoop project. It is the world’s most reliable storage system. It’s design is to storing large file and it provides high throughput.Whenever any file has to be written in HDFS, it is broken into small pieces of data known as blocks. HDFS has a default block size of 128 MB which can be increased as per the requirements.As we know Hadoop works in master-slave fashion, HDFS also has 2 types of nodes that work in the same manner. There are namenode(s) and datanodes in the cluster.1) Master node (Also called Name node) – As the name suggests, this node manages all the slave nodes and assign work to slaves. It should be deployed on reliable hardware as it is the centerpiece of HDFS.2) Slave node (Also called data node) – Datanodes are the slaves which are deployed on each machine and provide the actual storage. They are the actual worker nodes. These are responsible for serving read and write requests from the clients. They can be deployed on commodity hardware. If any slave node goes down, namenode automatically replicates the blocks which were present at that data node to other nodes in the cluster.To know more about the HDFS nodes: HDFS NODESLearn more : HDFS IntroductionHDFS ArchitectureHadoop HDFS has a Master/Slave architecture in which Master is NameNode and Slave is DataNode. HDFS Architecture consists of single NameNode and all the other nodes are DataNodes.For complete detail about HDFS Architecture: HDFS ARCHITECTUREAfter architecture of HDFS, I will recommend that learn READ WRITE OPERAtion of HDFS.Watch below video for write operation:For more detail refer the link: HDFS READ WRITE OPERATIONNow learn MapReduceMapReduce is the processing layer of Hadoop. MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing large volumes of data in parallel by dividing the work into a set of independent tasks. You just need to put business logic in the way MapReduce works and rest things will be taken care by the framework. Work (complete job) which is submitted by the user to master is divided into small works (tasks) and assigned to slaves.For more details about MapReduce click the below links:MapReduce – Data FlowMapReduce – MapperMapReduce – ReducerAfter learning HDFS, MapReduce move ahead with HBASE, PIG, HIVE.HIVEApache Hive is a data warehousing solution for Hadoop which provides data summarization, query, and ad-hoc analysis. It is used to process structured and semi-structured data in Hadoop. Analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop’s HDFS and also in Amazon S3 filesystem is supported by Hive. Like SQL hive also provides query language named HiveQL. Ad-hoc queries can be run using Hive for the data analytics. Earlier we have to write complex Map-Reduce jobs, but now with the help of Hive, we just need to submit merely SQL queries. These SQL queries are converted into MapReduce jobs by Hive.Hive ArchitectureThe diagram below shows basic architecture of HiveLearn more: Apache HIVELearn PIG: PIG Complete GuideLearn Hbase: Hbase Complete GuideHope this will help you while learning Big Data.","Answered Aug 9, 2017 · Author has 142 answers and 479k answer views",1,", Hadoop Developer at Cognizant",https://www.quora.com/profile/Shreya-441,2,Shreya,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-Big-Data-Hadoop-training-institute-in-Pune,32.0

316,"I would recommend you to first learn some basis of Big Data & Hadoop, and then move ahead for training. This will help you to grasp concepts in a more precise & clear manner. You can also go for online training instead of offline training, as there you’ll get an option to interact with industry professionals & subject matter experts.First start with understanding Big Data and challenges associated with Big Data. So, that you can understand how Hadoop emerged as a solution to those Big Data problems. This What is Hadoop and Hadoop Tutorial blog will introduce you to that.Then you should understand how Hadoop architecture works in respect of HDFS, YARN & MapReduce.Further moving on you should install Hadoop on your system so that you can start working with Hadoop. This will help you in understanding the practical aspects in detail.Further moving on take a deep dive into Hadoop Ecosystem and learn various tools inside Hadoop Ecosystem with their functionalities. So, that you will learn how to create a tailored solution according to your requirements.Let us understand in brief:What is Big Data?Big Data is a term used for a collection of data sets that are large and complex, which is difficult to store and process using available database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenge includes capturing, curating, storing, searching, sharing, transferring, analyzing and visualization of this data.It is characterized by 5 V’s.VOLUME: Volume refers to the ‘amount of data’, which is growing day by day at a very fast pace.VELOCITY: Velocity is defined as the pace at which different sources generate the data every day. This flow of data is massive and continuous.VARIETY: As there are many sources which are contributing to Big Data, the type of data they are generating is different. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured.VALUE: It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into value it is useless. Find insights in the data and make benefit out of it.VERACITY: Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness.What is Hadoop & it’s architecture?The main components of HDFS are NameNode and DataNode.NameNodeIt is the master daemon that maintains and manages the DataNodes (slave nodes). It records the metadata of all the files stored in the cluster, e.g. location of blocks stored, the size of the files, permissions, hierarchy, etc. It records each and every change that takes place to the file system metadata.For example, if a file is deleted in HDFS, the NameNode will immediately record this in the EditLog. It regularly receives a Heartbeat and a block report from all the DataNodes in the cluster to ensure that the DataNodes are live. It keeps a record of all the blocks in HDFS and in which nodes these blocks are stored.DataNodeThese are slave daemons which runs on each slave machine. The actual data is stored on DataNodes. They are responsible for serving read and write requests from the clients. They are also responsible for creating blocks, deleting blocks and replicating the same based on the decisions taken by the NameNode.For processing, we use YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator). The components of YARN are ResourceManager and NodeManager.ResourceManagerIt is a cluster level (one for each cluster) component and runs on the master machine. It manages resources and schedule applications running on top of YARN.NodeManagerIt is a node level component (one on each node) and runs on each slave machine. It is responsible for managing containers and monitoring resource utilization in each container. It also keeps track of node health and log management. It continuously communicates with ResourceManager to remain up-to-date.So, you can perform parallel processing on HDFS using MapReduce.MapReduceIt is the core component of processing in a Hadoop Ecosystem as it provides the logic of processing. In other words, MapReduce is a software framework which helps in writing applications that processes large data sets using distributed and parallel algorithms inside Hadoop environment. In a MapReduce program, Map() and Reduce() are two functions.The Map function performs actions like filtering, grouping and sorting.While Reduce function aggregates and summarizes the result produced by map function.The result generated by the Map function is a key value pair (K, V) which acts as the input for Reduce function.You can go through this video to understand Hadoop & it’s architecture in detail.Install Hadoop Single Node and Multi Node ClusterThen you can go through this Hadoop Ecosystem blog to learn Hadoop Ecosystem in detail.You can also go through this Hadoop Ecosystem tutorial video.PigPIG has two parts: Pig Latin, the language and the pig runtime, for the execution environment. You can better understand it as Java and JVM. It supports pig latin language.As everyone does not belong from a programming background. So, Apache PIG relieves them. You might be curious to know how?Well, I will tell you an interesting fact:10 line of pig latin = approx. 200 lines of Map-Reduce Java codeBut don’t be shocked when I say that at the back end of Pig job, a map-reduce job executes. The compiler internally converts pig latin to MapReduce. It produces a sequential set of MapReduce jobs, and that’s an abstraction (which works like black box). PIG was initially developed by Yahoo. It gives you a platform for building data flow for ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), processing and analyzing huge data sets.HiveFacebook created HIVE for people who are fluent with SQL. Thus, HIVE makes them feel at home while working in a Hadoop Ecosystem. Basically, HIVE is a data warehousing component which performs reading, writing and managing large data sets in a distributed environment using SQL-like interface.HIVE + SQL = HQLThe query language of Hive is called Hive Query Language(HQL), which is very similar like SQL. Hive is highly scalable. As, it can serve both the purposes, i.e. large data set processing (i.e. Batch query processing) and real time processing (i.e. Interactive query processing). Hive gets internally gets converted into MapReduce programs.It supports all primitive data types of SQL. You can use predefined functions, or write tailored user defined functions (UDF) also to accomplish your specific needs.You can store data in HBase based on your requirements.HBaseHBase is an open source, non-relational distributed database. In other words, it is a NoSQL database. It supports all types of data and that is why, it’s capable of handling anything and everything inside a Hadoop ecosystem. It is modelled after Google’s BigTable, which is a distributed storage system designed to cope up with large data sets.The HBase was designed to run on top of HDFS and provides BigTable like capabilities. It gives us a fault tolerant way of storing sparse data, which is common in most Big Data use cases. The HBase is written in Java, whereas HBase applications can be written in REST, Avro and Thrift APIs.For better understanding, let us take an example. You have billions of customer emails and you need to find out the number of customers who has used the word complaint in their emails. The request needs to be processed quickly (i.e. at real time). So, here we are handling a large data set while retrieving a small amount of data. For solving these kind of problems, HBase was designed.Edureka provides a good list of Hadoop Tutorial videos. I would recommend you to go through this Hadoop tutorial video playlist as well as Hadoop Tutorial blog series. Your learning should be aligned with Hadoop Certification.","Answered Jan 17, 2018 · Author has 326 answers and 601k answer views",1,", Big Data and Hadoop Enthusiast",https://www.quora.com/profile/Shubham-Sinha-202,5,Shubham Sinha,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-Big-Data-Hadoop-training-institute-in-Pune,32.0

482,"I would always recommend data science aspirants to go for a program which is classroom based , instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an institution/courseEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAnd in my opinion, Certifications are a proof that you have completed a course or a program and not a proof for what you have done. You must have read a lot of articles about educated unemployment or even come across some personal experiences wherein many students have masters degree but still are jobless!Why so?Well, because there is a huge skill gap between what industry wants and what’s in supply. Education system to a large extent has become a business game of just selling certificates. Therefore, it is not always necessary to rely on certifications. Theoretical information can be imparted easily. But what matters is the IMPLEMENTATION !We recently launched GreyAtom, an immersive learning program for engineers with our flagship program in Data Science. We are bringing classroom based learning with the strong online component to ensure the quality of the program.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education — We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program. Our focus is on building stuff and NOT CERTIFICATION.Focus on Industry Readiness — Our focus is on making our student’s industry ready. Our training platform “Commit.live” helps students build their profile on relevant platforms (GitHub, StackOverflow, Tech Blog) which are far more valuable than any certifications.Real Office Environment — We want to go away from classic “Coaching Institute” mentality. We want to mimic real industry experience throughout the program. Students will be working in an office environment.Quality EcoSystem — Our program is designed by the mix of industry practitioners and academician. All our instructors are people with hands-on experience and who have built some kick-ass stuff. We have an interview process before we enroll a student. Idea is to build qualitative ecosystem of experts and enthusiasts.Our Data Science ProgramWe have a separate track for freshers and working professionals. For freshers, there is a significant pre-work required before the start of the program.We have designed our program by interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. We also take continuous feedback from our premium community of data scientists (www.meetup.com/DataGiri/) which is now 4000 members strong.We already have some great industry partners on board with some really cool problem statements. Please visit an industry project section on our program page to get more details — Full Stack Data Science Engineering | GreyatomWe want to ensure that you should be able to write production-grade data science applications by end of the program. We cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.For the fact, India produces the highest number of engineering in the world and over 80% of them are unemployable. We are here to change that.Just to conclude, do not think GreyAtom as any other course, that’s not what we are trying to build. It’s an eco-system which helps improve industry readiness and quality of engineers.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career. Students built projects upon REAL DataSet and Problem Statements provided by our industry and hiring partners. Program is classroom based and heavily practice driven.

But mba in business analytics is not compulsory stuff, u can easily go for online courses from fab classes like simplilearn, jigsaw academy, edureka etc but in online mode u need to be very much self motivated and inspired by yourself as it is virtual mode so efforts put must be 10–15% more than offline modes, but if it is done in great passion it is by far best in cheap rate as well as u will get it in short span of period.Job scenerio:- Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional. Freshers might find tough to into analytics space so better is gain experience for 2-3yrs side by side start your learning and after some years, go for interview and Get into your analytics life.Salary as per analytics india magazine is as follows:-0-4years experienced folks with all knowledge of r, python, excel can earn upto 10-12lacs that too from big shot mncs whereas startups will give u around 5-8lacs depending upon the nature and status of the startup.Learning methodology:- It hardly takes 6months of practice with weekly commitment of around 4-5hrs is enough to atleast cover all big data analytics concepts like Hadoop, hbase, hive, sqoop, spark, pig, mapreduce, scala, Cassandra, mongodb, storm, kafka written in java or python... But actual used tools in major companies are Hadoop(getting obsolete because of top class spark which is same as Hadoop only reliability, speed, one to two concepts differs), Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, Pig,Hdfs, Mapreduce.Note:- Tools differs but Concepts are majorly drawn from old ones. Easy to learn Any tools but Getting handson on concepts and realizing the actual working of the concepts plays a vital role in analytics domain.I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets.Coming to the courses mentioning below check it:-There are many other options which are having less fees, quality education, rich content as per latest market scenerio.I feel so for recently launched online or off line pgp courses in business analytics @ Praxis bschool which has tieup with PwC and icici for online and full time course at bangalore and kolkata campud and in collaboration with IIDT at hyderabad campus in association with Hyderabad government. Even recently they have launched online courses on pg data science and business analytics for 8-12months duration, fees very less plus earn a degree from a aicte approved institute,placement support same as full time batch and every month one industry expert will come n take session via VLP.The course at praxis is very well structured and delivered and all are preferably for atleast 2yrs experienced folks but they are all distance learning courses via VLP mode. They are fabulous in their contents, facilities, faculties, support,brand..If you want to do pg then go and do it from praxis as they have launched recently enabled online course they are best by far less cost and rich contents with great placement support after 6months duration. Believe me placement is also there even for online course offered by praxis business school.Praxis has thrived hard to be the best in all terms whether it is online or offline specially in data science domain in india or in asia for providing cutting edges practices....Course in collaboration with Chennai based edu tech startup see their partner program page in praxis college website it will show you all mandatory details. Fees for full time is 5lacs but only in Bangalore and kolkata so those who want to learn from a very reputed bschool plus good placement assistance plus great faculty then praxis would ne far better and for online mode also fees is very less plus placement assistance is provided as per one preference.Websites like KAGGLE, AIM & AVIDHYA will help.Best business schools in analytics space in asia as per many sources :-Praxis business school(backed by icici and pwc experts) Great full time and online mode classesIIM-C + ISI-C + IIT-K(Immensely Best in all terms)Countries Speacially in:-Best data analytics courses are available in india, usa, canada & Ireland...

486,"Good to see that you are entering into a field which has a thriving career. So, before talking about good big data training institutes, I would like to make you clear that learning big data includes more of hands on labs, as it is more of practical based.Watch this recent video on Big Data which explains big data technology with various different real time examples.So, here you can figure out what level of training is required for big data technology. One such type of training institute that I know is Big Data Hadoop Training Intellipaat from where my friend pursued big data training, and on the basis of his experience I am suggesting you for Intellipaat big data online training, as he had an excellent training and he talked a lot about that training institute, so I believe that it is definitely going to be a good training provider for big data. Besides Intellipaat is an online training institute for big data, so you don’t even need to search for classroom training for big data in Mumbai.

511,"Let us understand in brief:What is Big Data?Big Data is a term used for a collection of data sets that are large and complex, which is difficult to store and process using available database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenge includes capturing, curating, storing, searching, sharing, transferring, analyzing and visualization of this data.It is characterized by 5 V’s.VOLUME: Volume refers to the ‘amount of data’, which is growing day by day at a very fast pace.VELOCITY: Velocity is defined as the pace at which different sources generate the data every day. This flow of data is massive and continuous.VARIETY: As there are many sources which are contributing to Big Data, the type of data they are generating is different. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured.VALUE: It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into value it is useless. Find insights in the data and make benefit out of it.VERACITY: Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness.Technology has evolved a lot, we can use Big data as an opportunity. Earlier, we were spending too much money on storage. Until Big Data came into the picture, we never thought of using commodity hardware to store and manage our data which is both reliable and feasible as compared to the costly servers. But later, organisations realized that they are getting lot of benefits by Big Data Analytics.Problems with Traditional Approach :The first problem is storing the colossal amount of data. Storing this huge data in a traditional system is not possible. The reason is obvious, the storage will be limited to one system and the data is increasing in tremendous rate.Second problem is storing heterogeneous data. Now we know storing is a problem, but let me tell you it is just one part of the problem. The data is not only huge, but it is present in various formats as well like: Unstructured, Semi-structured and Structured. So, you need to make sure that you have a system to store these varieties of data, generated from various sources.The third problem is accessing and processing speed. The hard disk capacity is increasing but disk transfer speed or the access speed is not increasing at similar rate. Let me explain you this with an example: If you have only one 100mbps I/O channel and you are processing say 1TB of data, it will take around 2.91 hours. Now, if you have four machines with four I/O channels for the same amount of data, then it will take 43 minutes approx. Thus for me, accessing and processing speed is the bigger problem than storage of Big Data.Hadoop Coming into Picture:In 2003, Google launches project Nutch to handle billions of searches and indexing millions of web pages. Later in Oct 2003 – Google releases papers with GFS (Google File System). In Dec 2004, Google releases papers with MapReduce. In 2005, Nutch used GFS and MapReduce to perform operations. In 2006, Yahoo created Hadoop based on GFS and MapReduce with Doug Cutting and team. You would be surprised if I would tell you that, in 2007 Yahoo started using Hadoop on a 1000 node cluster.What is Hadoop?Hadoop is a framework that allows you to first store Big Data in a distributed environment so that you can process it parallely. There are basically two components in Hadoop:HDFS creates an abstraction of resources, let me simplify it for you. Similar as virtualization, you can see HDFS logically as a single unit for storing Big Data, but actually you are storing your data across multiple nodes in a distributed fashion. Here, you have master-slave architecture. In HDFS, Namenode is a master node and Datanodes are slaves.YARN performs all your processing activities by allocating resources and scheduling tasks. It has two major components, i.e. ResourceManager and NodeManager.Hadoop-as-a-SolutionThe first problem is storing Big data. HDFS solved it, let’s know how.HDFS provides a distributed way to store Big data. Your Data is stored in blocks in data nodes and you specify the size of each block. Basically, if you have 512MB of data and you have configured HDFS such that it will create 128 MB of data blocks. So HDFS will divide data into 4 blocks as 512/128=4 and store it across different DataNodes, it will also replicate the data blocks on different DataNodes. Now, as we are using commodity hardware, hence storing is not a challenge.It also solves the scaling problem. It focuses on horizontal scaling instead of vertical scaling. You can always add some extra data nodes to HDFS cluster as and when required, instead of scaling up the resources of your data nodes. Let me summarize it for you basically for storing 1 TB of data I don’t need a 1TB system. You can instead do it on multiple 128GB systems or even less.Next problem was storing the variety of data. This problem is also addressed by HDFS.With HDFS you can store all kinds of data whether it is structured, semi-structured or unstructured. Since in HDFS, there is no pre-dumping schema validation. And it also follows write once and read many models. Due to this, you can just write the data once and you can read it multiple times for finding insights.If you can recall, the third challenge was accessing & processing the data faster. Yes, this is one of the major challenges with Big Data. In order to solve it, we move processing to data and not data to processing. What does it mean? Instead of moving data to the master node and then processing it. In YARN, the processing logic is sent to the various slave nodes & then data is processed parallely across different slave nodes. Then the processed results are sent to the master node where the results are merged and the response is sent back to the client.Hadoop is used for:Search – Yahoo, Amazon, ZventsLog processing – Facebook, YahooData Warehouse – Facebook, AOLVideo and Image Analysis – New York Times, EyealikeEdureka provides a good list of Hadoop Tutorial videos. I would recommend you to go through this Hadoop tutorial video playlist as well as Hadoop Tutorial blog series.

It effieciently stores massive amount of data. It stores data in any form like structure, unstructured and semistructured. It stores data in HDFS.Watch below video for soft introduction of Hadoop:Why Hadoop and How Hadoop provided the solution?Earlier we were using an RDBMS. By using traditional method we were not able to store huge amount of data. Today we are generating data in huge amount but earlier data were not generated like now so we were storing data in RDBMS efficiently. As the data size increases, we started getting problem in storing then Hadoop emerged as a solution to Big data.The Second problem was that RDBMS only stores data in the structured form which is its major drawback, but today the 80% of data generation is unstructured. Hadoop stores all types of data that’s why we say that Hadoop is flexible.For more detail refer below link:Hadoop guideAfter basics of Hadoop, let’s move towards complex part.Hadoop mainly consists of MapReduce, HDFS and Yarn.Let’s start with MapReduce.MapReduceMapReduce is the heart of hadoop. It is the processing part of Hadoop. It is a programming model design for processing large volume of data in parallel.MapReduce programs are written in a particular style influenced by functional programming constructs, specifical idioms for processing lists of data. Here in map reduce we get input as a list and it converts it into output which is again a list.To know more: MapReduce in depthLet’s learn MapReduce funcion in depth.MapReduce consists of two parts-1 - Map2- ReduceMap()-Map works is to split the input data stream in a key and value pairs. For example let’s take a phrase this is good girl.Map splits it into (“this, 1”), (“is,1″), (“good,1”), (“girl,1”)where key= a word , value = 1Let’s take a look at the below image:If you will try to understand the image then you will get that how map and reduce works. Map() splits the input data and reduce() combined it and make a proper output as per our desire.The output of the mapper is processed by the Reducer. After processing the data, it produces a new set of output, which will be stored in the HDFS.To know more in detail about Mapper and Reducer refer below link:Mapper in MapReduceReducer in MapReduceNow, Let’s move towards Hadoop EcosystemRefer this link to learn : Hadoop Ecosystem ComponentsNow let’s learn HDFS.HDFSApache Hadoop HDFS is a distributed file system which provides redundant storage space for storing files which are huge in sizes; files which are in the range of Terabytes and Petabytes. In HDFS data is stored reliably. Files are broken into blocks and distributed across nodes in a cluster. After that each block is replicated, means copies of blocks are created on different machines. Hence if a machine goes down or gets crashed, then also we can easily retrieve and access our data from different machines. By default, 3 copies of a file are created on different machines. Hence it is highly fault-tolerant. HDFS provides faster file read and writes mechanism, as data is stored in different nodes in a cluster. Hence the user can easily access the data from any machine in a cluster. Hence HDFS is highly used as a platform for storing huge volume and different varieties of data worldwide.To know more : Hadoop HDFS complete guideAfter its Introduction let’s move towards its architecture.HDFS ArchitectureHadoop HDFS has a Master/Slave architecture in which Master is NameNodeand Slave is DataNode.

513,"Big Data is the actual problem and Hadoop is one of the solution for handling the big data which is used by the companies and other social media networks.Big Data and Hadoop are the trending things currently in the IT environment. More and more people are taking up these certifications to scale up to the latest trend and upgrading themselves with the latest technologies.I will tell you what is Big Data and Hadoop and why we need to do this Hadoop certification.Big DataBig Data is actually the data that is huge in size and its nothing but the data that is generated by various companies or social media platforms. If you consider a social media like Facebook, just storing the number of active users currently would itself be a big data as there would be millions of people accessing the Facebook at a time around the globe.So if we need to further store the user’s activities, their likes, shares and comments, then the data would be still more and it would be measured not in Gigabytes but in terms of Terabytes or Petabytes. So just imagine how much space would be required to store such a big amount of data and the thing is the data would be keep on increasing and so any allotted space would become full after a period of time.Since the data is huge it is not easy to align or sort these data in any particular order. So most of the data would remain unstructured. So even processing of these big data would be really difficult with normal database tools like Excel or RDBMS. So we need to go for something else in order to store and process the data. That is why we can use Hadoop.Big Data is defined by 5 V’s which are listed belowVolume defines the huge amount of data that is produced each day by companies, for example. The generation of data is so large and complex that it can no longer be saved or analyzed using conventional data processing methods.Variety refers to the diversity of data types and data sources. 80 percent of the data in the world today is unstructured and at first glance does not show any indication of relationships. Thanks to Big Data such algorithms, data is able to be sorted in a structured manner and examined for relationships. Data does not always comprise only conventional datasets, but also images, videos and speech recordings.Velocity refers to the speed with which the data is generated, analyzed and reprocessed. Today this is mostly possible within a fraction of a second, known as real time.Validity is the guarantee of the data quality or, alternatively, Veracity is the authenticity and credibility of the data. Big Data involves working with all degrees of quality, since the Volume factor usually results in a shortage of quality.Value denotes the added value for companies. Many companies have recently established their own data platforms, filled their data pools and invested a lot of money in infrastructure. It is now a question of generating business value from their investments.What is Hadoop?Hadoop is developed by Apache and it is an open source tool whose source code can be modified by any developers according to their requirements. It is done based on the Google’s MapReduce, a framework which is used to segregate a large part into a set of smaller parts. So Hadoop would divide a Big Data into small sets of data and store them on different servers at a time.So if we need to do any data manipulation or for searching any particular record, then it would be made faster using Hadoop as it would process small parts of data in parallel by different server and so fetching any particular record would be faster when compared with storing the Big Data in only one server.Why to take Hadoop certification for Big Data:Hadoop is one of the techniques used for handling Big Data. We dont need to have technical expertise in order to take up this certification. Even having some basic knowledge should do like Java, sql queries etc. So anyone can do this certification and try for the opening available in various companies for Hadoop professionals. It is also cost effective, scalable and flexible according to the needs of the companies.There is a good demand for Hadoop professionals and the companies are ready to pay how much ever they want if they match with their requirements. They would be taking people for the role of Hadoop developers, Data analysts, Hadoop testers etc.More Information about Hadoop certification examHere I am providing you some of the useful information for learning the Hadoop certification exam.HDPCA certification in HortonworksHDP Certified Administrator (HDPCA) CertificationWhat Is Apache HadoopWhy is Hadoop important?I hope this helps!!If you are looking for any help in preparing for the Hadoop certification exams, please send me a message.","Answered Sep 27, 2017 · Author has 233 answers and 257.1k answer views",1,", PMP / Big Data / AWS / Azure / Trainer",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ritika-Prasad-30,2,Ritika Prasad,https://www.quora.com/What-is-big-data-or-Hadoop,51.0

For now let’s come to Big DataBig DataSimply mentioning, Big Data is huge volume of data sets generating with fast velocity and various variety of information assets. This Big Data ranges in 100s of TBs.This huge data is generated from everything that is digitized or connected to electronic devices. It is produced from what you store on mobile phone and desktop and from your activities on it. Whenever you are on a website, perform activities on social media, update your contact list, your every activity is tracked in the form of data.Data is produced when you visit to places like hospitals, shopping malls, retail stores restaurants etc and your likes/dislikes, budget, heath status and every minute is detail about you is tracked in the form of data. Data is collected from various sensors, cameras etc.Big Data is also generated from non - human entities like an airplane, satellite, an electric pole, connected cars etc.All this Data is collected, processed and analysed by marketers to know their target audience better, narrow down their targeting so that they can approach audience with more customized advertising. Scientist use this data to for providing better safety and data can also enhance the process of machine learning.To study the use cases of Big Data you can visit this this link: Various use cases of Big dataThe Big Data Problem and Hadoop as solution to itBig Data is bulky, poorly or less structured, unwieldy data beyond the petabyte. This data is incomprehensible to human scale.Many years, around a decade ago, google innovated a way that Yahoo propagated to spread data out across large commodity clusters and process simple batch to begin to mine big Data sets on ad-hoc batch basis economically. This method later evolved as Hadoop.Hadoop is the most popular and huge in-demand Big Data tool. There are others as well like Spark, Lumify, Apache strom, Apache samoa etc, but Hadoop is popularly used.Hadoop is an open source, scalable and fault tolerant framework from ASF - Apache Software foundation and is coded in Java. By Open source it means it is available for free to everyone and its source can also be changed as per the requirements.Hadoop processes Big data on a cluster of commodity hardware. If a certain functionality doesn’t work or fulfill your need, then you can change it accordingly.Popular companies of Hadoop are Yahoo, IBM, Facebook and Cloudera.Hadoop is not only a storage system; it is a platform for huge data storage and processing.It provides a systematic framework for running jobs on multiple nodes of clusters. ( A Cluster means a group of systems connected via LAN. A computer located outside the LAN can also be a part of cluster.)Apache Hadoop does parallel processing of data as it process on multiple machines simultaneously.A very nice video on HadoopBackbone of HadoopHadoop provides world’s most reliable storage layer – HDFS, a batch Processing engine –MapReduce and a Resource Management Layer – YARN.HDFS - Hadoop distributed filesystem is a storage layer designed for storing big number of files running on cluster of commodity hardware. It’s principle of design is: “Store less number of large files rather than huge number of small files”.HDFS provides fault tolerant storage for Hadoop and its other components. This happens due to its default replication of data feature. (will see this later).MapReduce - MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing big volumes of data. This is done in parallel by dividing the work into a set of dependent tasks.You just have to put business logic in a way that MapReduce works. Rest of the work will be handles by the framework.Yarn - Yet Another Resource Negotiator allows different data processing engines such as graph processing, interactive processing, stream processing and batch processing to run and process data stored in HDFS. Yarn also does job Scheduling.Some of the significant features of Hadoop are:Open SourceApache Hadoop is an open source program or framework, that is, its code can be modified by any for free according to business requirements.2. Distributed ProcessingThe Big Data is stored in the HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System in a distributed manner across the cluster. The data then is processed on a cluster of nodes.3. Fault ToleranceApache Hadoop is highly fault tolerant. It, by default stores 3 replicas of each block across the cluster in Hadoop. If any of nodes goes down, data at that node can be obtained from the other nodes easily. Learn more about: fault tolerant.4. ReliabilityDue to the feature of replication of data in cluster, client can be reliable on data stored on the cluster of machine despite of machine failures.5. High AvailabilityBig Data is highly available and accessible inspite of the failure of nodes due to multiple copies of data in it. Even if a machine crashes, data can be accessed from another path.6. ScalabilityHadoop is highly scalable as nodes can be extended upto any number . It is also aid with horizontal scalability, i.e. new nodes can be easily added on the fly without any downtime.7. EconomicApache Hadoop is very economic as it runs on a cluster of commodity hardware. No specialized machine is needed for it. Hadoop also provides huge cost savings as it is very easy to add more nodes.8. Easy to useThere is no need for client to deal with distributed computing, the framework handles of all the things. So it is easy to use.9. Data LocalityHadoop works on data locality principle. This principle states that “move computation to data instead of data to computation”. Whenever a client submits the MapReduce algorithm, this algorithm is moved to data in the storage cluster rather than bringing data to the location where the algorithm is submitted and then processing it.Hadoop EcosystemThe ecosystem of Hadoop constitues of HDFS and HDFS components, MapReduce, YARN, Hive, Apache Pig, Apache HBase and HBase components, HCatalogue, Avro, Thrift, Drill, Apache mahout, Sqoop, Apache Flume, Ambari, Zookeeper and Apache OOzie to deep dive into Big Data Hadoop and become master of the Hadoop technology.Learn About Hadoop ecosystem in detail>>Now you understand that Big Data is the problem and Hadoop is the solution to it.I have provided some links below if you want to know more about HadoopBig Data Terminologies and Hadoop Concepts You Must KnowHow Hadoop Works - Learn the Internal Working of HadoopLimitations of Hadoop - How to overcomeHope the answer helped!All the Best!","Answered Jan 18, 2018 · Author has 534 answers and 297.6k answer views",1,", Perform analysis of vast data stores and uncover insights",https://www.quora.com/profile/Shailna-Patidar-4,3,Shailna Patidar,https://www.quora.com/What-is-big-data-or-Hadoop,51.0

524,"While I can talk about why Ivy Professional School is the best Data Analytics and Data Science institute with placement opportunities [1] and why it has been ranked among the top data science schools in the country (2014, 2015, 2016) by reputed AIM / SiliconIndia, I will focus on all the important parameters to judge an institute:Course Content & International Certifications - The most important aspect about any analytics course is the content it covers. A good short-term data science should ideally cover: 1) Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Visualization toolslike SAS, R, Python, Excel, VBA, SQL, RDBMS, Tableau, etc. 2) Big Data Tools like - Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Mahout, etc.3) Basic to Advanced Statistical Modeling Concepts like - Linear / Logisitc Regression, Time Series, Decision Trees, Clustering, Random Forest, Optimization, etc.4) Machine Learning Concepts like - SVM, NLP, Parallel Computing, IR, Supervised / Un-supervised Learning, etc. Ivy’s Data Science / Analytics Certification Programs (with Machine Learning Add-on) cover all of the above and more. It also prepares you for theInternational Certifications from SAS, EMC2, Cloudera, Tableau, etc.Faculty Team - You want to join an institute to learn from the experiences of the faculty team (otherwise you can learn for free from YouTube). While judging a faculty team, you should ideally focus on: 1) Industry experience - An industry experienced faculty member could only bring relevant examples into training. 2) Education background - A faculty with strong education background could ensure solid theoretical understanding of the concepts for high quality training. 3) Training experience - Faculty should have had teaching experience to be able to connect with the students. Often industry experienced professionals, without any teaching experience, find it difficult to connect with the students. Ivy Professional School’s data science faculty team has 100+ years of industry experience with strong education background from IIM, IIT, ISI, US Universities, etc. They have strong teaching experience as well.Industry Connect - A strong and legitimate industry connect is important for content relevancy and placements. Be wary of any institute which says placement is guaranteed. Ivy Professional School is an official learning partner of large analytics companies like Genpact, HSBC, Capgemini, ICRA, Moody’s analytics, eBay/PayPal, Cognizant, etc. Ivy also has the experience of conducting multiple industry sponsored / joint-certification business analytics batches for companies like Genpact, Mu Sigma, Affine Analytics, etc. Ivy’s analytics / data science alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies.Experience - In education, experience of an institute matters as with time an institute learns / re-learns / evolves its course content, builds credibility among recruiters, refines its processes, etc. Also, with experience, an institute builds a strong alumni network, which helps significantly in placement process as well. Ivy Professional School was among the first institutes in India to launch analytics / data science programs. Ivy has been running analytics /data science programs since 2008.Past Placement Record - Past placement record can tell a lot about an institute’s performance and acceptability in the industry. Take the list of past alumni and verify on Linkedin. Ivy Professional School’s alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies[2]. Their profiles could be verified on LinkedIn. Click here to download Ivy’s recently placed students list.Alumni Testimonials - Review what institute’s alumni say about their experience with the institute. If possible, reach out to them. You can read Ivy Professional School’s alumni reviews here.Convenience to Learn Online or In-Class-Room near your home town / city - It could be very inconvenient to travel for short-term courses. Also, you may or may not be comfortable learning only online. Hence, look for an institute which could offer class-room as well as an online option. Ivy Professional School offers three modes of learning in various metros (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, etc.): 1) Class-room training option available in Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune (more cities coming soon) 2) Online - Live 3) Online - Self paced / recordedHaving said that, should you want to discuss anything related to analytics / data science or your profile, I’ll be more than happy to discuss that personally with you.Thanks,Prateek Agrawal | Co-founder | Ivy Professional School | Past experience in management consulting with Big 5 consulting firmsFootnotes[1] Analytics Certification Courses - R, SAS, Hadoop, Tableau | Big Data Certification | Ivy Pro School[2] http://ivyproschool.com/wp-conte...","Answered Jun 6, 2016",1,", Have in-house experts with 100+ years of Data Analytics experience.",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivy-Professional-School-1,0,Ivy Professional School,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-institute-in-Mumbai-for-big-data-analytics-with-the-best-placement,52.0

From Data Mining, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing to Linux, Algorithmic Training and Internet of Things – over the course of 8 months, SP Jain’s BDVA program takes you deep into every aspect of Big Data. And, not simply from a theoretical perspective, but also through practical, real-world projects and industry internships that help students, especially those with little or no work experience, supplement their academic knowledge with real-life industry experience, make meaningful contributions to companies, build strong professional contacts and explore full-time career opportunities. The program is truly your gateway to exploring, analyzing and unravelling the complex, unstructured data-driven world. The program kicks off with a 'Data Science Foundation' that builds a strong foundation for the second stage of the program which incorporates more in-depth and application-based learning. Given the need for specialist knowledge, they provide a range of specializations in cutting-edge topics like Banking & Financial Analytics and Marketing Analytics.  On completion of the program students would have learned to apply quantitative modelling and data analysis techniques to solve real-world business problems, successfully present results using data visualization techniques, demonstrate knowledge of statistical data analysis techniques utilized in business decision-making, apply principles of Data Science to the analysis of business problems, use data mining software to solve real-world problems and employ cutting-edge tools and technologies to analyze Big Data.","Answered Apr 22, 2018 · Author has 87 answers and 34.3k answer views",1,,https://www.quora.com/profile/Rebecca-Dsouza-29,2,Rebecca Dsouza,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-institute-in-Mumbai-for-big-data-analytics-with-the-best-placement,52.0

It is 3rd globally and 2nd among academic institutions for Big Data certifications. The placements are also quite good.Online Courses & Training in Analytics, Big Data Science, SAS & R - Jigsaw Academy is an online and relatively cheaper option. The faculty includes industry experts with decades of experience and also provides placement assistance although I have no data to support this. They will probably help you get placed through their alumni and personal network.If you have the option to choose a more traditional approach then you have great offerings from the top institutes:1. Certified Program in Business Analytics (CBA) – Indian School of Business:The offering from Indian School of Business (ISB) continues to retain the top spot in this year rankings as well. The course covers several topics and is run in a format where the students have to attend class rooms every alternate month. The course uses technology aided platform during the months of no classroom. There is ample industry interaction and a 3 – 6 month project at the end of the course. With the ISB brand and tie-up with SAS, the course provides almost everything a person would have wished for!I say almost because the only thing which goes against the course is considerably higher fees compared to other courses. Add the expense of travelling to Hyderabad every alternate month and you might end up thinking twice, even if you get selected for the program.2. PGPBA – Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai and GurgaonGreat Lakes arrived with its analytics programme slightly late into the game, but when it came – it came in style! It comes closest to challenge ISB with its focus on structured thinking and business application. The format is again a mix of classroom and tech aided platform. Significant industry interaction, tie-up with Jigsaw Academy to deliver online content and option to choose from 2 destination are some of the reasons why this course makes it to this spot.My discontent with this course is mainly the lack of focus on a particular tool. While tool is only a means to an end, depth on at least one tool would make the offering very compelling. You can read detailed review about the program here.3. Certificate program in business analytics for executives (CPBAE)- IIM LucknowThis course is taught jointly by faculty from IIM Lucknow and Kelley School of Business. The course is divided in 4 modules and requires a residency in each module. In addition, there is a tie-up with SAS for E-Miner training at the end. The positives for the course include 2 (or 3 if you take up SAS training) big brands backing it up with a wide range of topics.The main discontent with the past participants of the programme has been the gap between what is taught in the classroom and what is required on the job. As per discussions with one of past participants (with 6 years of experience in IT before taking this course) “The focus on practical aspects and applications needs to be higher.”4. Executive Programme in Business Analytics – IIM KolkataThe course is spread over a year and is divided in 10 modules. With only 2 visits on the campus, majority of the course is delivered through Hughes Education. While the programme has lower work experience requirement compared to some of the counter parts, relatively lower class room interactions make it a less desired choice. Again, the focus is on covering a range of topics and the theory behind them as opposed to practical applications on the job.5. Business analytics and Intelligence – IIM BangaloreIIM Bangalore was probably the pioneer in starting the one year executive programme in Analytics. This course is again a mix of classroom and online platform, with an optional module to cover SAS E-Miner at the end. The positives include a course which covers wide range of algorithms and topics and is backed by the brand of an IIM.Apart from that, if you work hard enough you can learn from online courses and materials and still get a job.Satyaki Roy's answer to What is the best MOOC to get started in Data Science?","Answered Jan 18, 2017",0,", Analytics Consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers (2016-present)",https://www.quora.com/profile/Satyaki-Roy,0,Satyaki Roy,https://www.quora.com/What-is-best-data-analytics-institute-with-placement-opportunity,54.0

But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an institution/courseEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAnd in my opinion, Certifications are a proof that you have completed a course or a program and not a proof for what you have done. You must have read a lot of articles about educated unemployment or even come across some personal experiences wherein many students have masters degree but still are jobless!Why so?Well, because there is a huge skill gap between what industry wants and what’s in supply. Education system to a large extent has become a business game of just selling certificates. Therefore, it is not always necessary to rely on certifications. Theoretical information can be imparted easily. But what matters is the IMPLEMENTATION !We recently launched GreyAtom, an immersive learning program for engineers with our flagship program in Data Science. We are bringing classroom based learning with the strong online component to ensure the quality of the program.Why did we decide to start GreyAtom?Problem with existing Eco-System in IndiaEngineering education is too theoretical. We waste 3 to 4 years to get a degree which hardly adds any industry knowledge. I faced the same situation 10 years back when I graduated — Unfortunately, it’s still the same.Most of the Private Institutes are in the business of selling certification. They pick buzz words like Data Science, Digital Marketing etc. and make money in the name of certification.Most of the engineers are still away from real industry tools and practices (test driven development, code versioning, pair programming, working with cloud etc).We still follow rules like — you need 60% aggregate to participate in campus placement. Because of such rules, students are crazy to score percentage rather than gaining some real knowledge.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education — We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program. Our focus is on building stuff and NOT CERTIFICATION.Focus on Industry Readiness — Our focus is on making our student’s industry ready. Our training platform “Commit.live” helps students build their profile on relevant platforms (GitHub, StackOverflow, Tech Blog) which are far more valuable than any certifications.Real Office Environment — We want to go away from classic “Coaching Institute” mentality. We want to mimic real industry experience throughout the program. Students will be working in an office environment.Quality EcoSystem — Our program is designed by the mix of industry practitioners and academician. All our instructors are people with hands-on experience and who have built some kick-ass stuff. We have an interview process before we enroll a student. Idea is to build qualitative ecosystem of experts and enthusiasts.Our Data Science ProgramWe have a separate track for freshers and working professionals. For freshers, there is a significant pre-work required before the start of the program.We have designed our program by interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. We also take continuous feedback from our premium community of data scientists (www.meetup.com/DataGiri/) which is now 4000 members strong.We already have some great industry partners on board with some really cool problem statements. Please visit an industry project section on our program page to get more details — Full Stack Data Science Engineering | GreyatomWe want to ensure that you should be able to write production-grade data science applications by end of the program. We cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.Job Placements:My personal opinion - Do not join any program if they give ""Job Guarantee"". Always evaluate what you are going to learn. Think of it as an investment in yourself.GreyAtom does not guarantee the job. We do guarantee knowledge and high-quality ecosystem. We do guarantee real industry partners who want to hire if you work hard and show them what you can do.We are committed to giving absolute best from our end to help you achieve your objective of joining the program.For the fact, India produces the highest number of engineering in the world and over 80% of them are unemployable. We are here to change that.Just to conclude, do not think GreyAtom as any other course, that’s not what we are trying to build. It’s an eco-system which helps improve industry readiness and quality of engineers.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career. Students built projects upon REAL DataSet and Problem Statements provided by our industry and hiring partners. Program is classroom based and heavily practice driven. GreyAtom is an ecosystem where students can leverage the best from academia, industry practitioners and influencers.Some quick linksProgram - http://www.greyatom.com/full-sta...Chat with Academic Counsellor - You're welcome to share all your doubts, insecurities paying an ear to which we'll try our level best to guide you to your career path of success. https://calendly.com/greyatom/co...","Answered May 11, 2018 · Author has 494 answers and 957.7k answer views",2,", Co-Founder GreyAtom,Data Science Immersive Learning school",https://www.quora.com/profile/Shweta-Doshi-12,1,Shweta Doshi,https://www.quora.com/What-is-best-data-analytics-institute-with-placement-opportunity,54.0

544,"While I can talk about why Ivy Professional School is the best Data Analytics and Data Science institute with placement opportunities[1] and why it has been ranked among the top data science schools in the country (2014, 2015, 2016) by reputed AIM / SiliconIndia, I will focus on all the important parameters to judge an institute:Course Content & International Certifications - The most important aspect about any analytics course is the content it covers. A good short-term data science should ideally cover: 1) Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Visualization tools like SAS, R, Python, Excel, VBA, SQL, RDBMS, Tableau, etc. 2) Big Data Tools like - Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Mahout, etc.3) Basic to Advanced Statistical Modeling Concepts like - Linear / Logisitc Regression, Time Series, Decision Trees, Clustering, Random Forest, Optimization, etc.4) Machine Learning Concepts like - SVM, NLP, Parallel Computing, IR, Supervised / Un-supervised Learning, etc. Ivy’s Data Science / Analytics Certification Programs (with Machine Learning Add-on) cover all of the above and more. It also prepares you for the International Certifications from SAS, EMC2, Cloudera, Tableau, etc.Faculty Team - You want to join an institute to learn from the experiences of the faculty team (otherwise you can learn for free from YouTube). While judging a faculty team, you should ideally focus on: 1) Industry experience - An industry experienced faculty member could only bring relevant examples into training. 2) Education background - A faculty with strong education background could ensure solid theoretical understanding of the concepts for high quality training. 3) Training experience - Faculty should have had teaching experience to be able to connect with the students. Often industry experienced professionals, without any teaching experience, find it difficult to connect with the students. Ivy Professional School’s data science faculty team has 100+ years of industry experience with strong education background from IIM, IIT, ISI, US Universities, etc. They have strong teaching experience as well.Industry Connect - A strong and legitimate industry connect is important for content relevancy and placements. Be wary of any institute which says placement is guaranteed. Ivy Professional School is an official learning partner of large analytics companies like Genpact, HSBC, Capgemini, ICRA, Moody’s analytics, eBay/PayPal, Cognizant, etc. Ivy also has the experience of conducting multiple industry sponsored / joint-certification business analytics batches for companies like Genpact, Mu Sigma, Affine Analytics, etc. Ivy’s analytics / data science alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies.Experience - In education, experience of an institute matters as with time an institute learns / re-learns / evolves its course content, builds credibility among recruiters, refines its processes, etc. Also, with experience, an institute builds a strong alumni network, which helps significantly in placement process as well. Ivy Professional School was among the first institutes in India to launch analytics / data science programs. Ivy has been running analytics /data science programs since 2008.Past Placement Record - Past placement record can tell a lot about an institute’s performance and acceptability in the industry. Take the list of past alumni and verify on Linkedin. Ivy Professional School’s alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies[2]. Their profiles could be verified on LinkedIn. Click here to download Ivy’s recently placed students list.Alumni Testimonials - Review what institute’s alumni say about their experience with the institute. If possible, reach out to them. You can read Ivy Professional School’s alumni reviews here.Convenience to Learn Online or In-Class-Room near your home town / city - It could be very inconvenient to travel for short-term courses. Also, you may or may not be comfortable learning only online. Hence, look for an institute which could offer class-room as well as an online option. Ivy Professional School offers three modes of learning in various metros (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, etc.): 1) Class-room training option available in Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune (more cities coming soon) 2) Online - Live 3) Online - Self paced / recordedHaving said that, should you want to discuss anything related to analytics / data science or your profile, I’ll be more than happy to discuss that personally with you.Thanks,Prateek Agrawal | Co-founder | Ivy Professional School | Past experience in management consulting with Big 5 consulting firmsFootnotes[1] Analytics Certification Courses - R, SAS, Hadoop, Tableau | Big Data Certification | Ivy Pro School[2] http://ivyproschool.com/wp-conte...","Answered Jun 6, 2016",1,", Have in-house experts with 100+ years of Data Analytics experience.",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivy-Professional-School-1,3,Ivy Professional School,https://www.quora.com/What-is-best-data-analytics-institute-with-placement-opportunity,54.0

547,"I don't have data to support who has the best record in job placement, but I'll offer what I have observed.The main problem with this is the fact that data analytics is still a new field, and academics have only recently started offering programs that are tailored to pure data science.Also, data science is a broad field and pulls talent from many different sources. The two most important concepts of data science is Computer Science and Statistics. Both concepts are of equal weight, but computer science is more beneficial because students will be exposed to plenty of math (and likely statistics), so they will have a better foundation to learn the other.Statistics on the other hand is incredibly hard to master, and data scientist don’t exactly need that level of knowledge (mathematician level) to be successful. Moreover, a statistics major isn't likely to have much exposure to computer science.Now for the specific data science programs (and sub categories, I.e. Data analytics), I'm not sure who has the best. I have heard disappointing thing about the Cal Berkeley program, and they usually rank high in STEM fields. I would imagine if the Ivy League schools offer it, they will be at the top. I'm sure if MIT has one it will be in the top 10.Data science isn't brand new, but it's still in its infancy for academics. Getting a degree in analytics now is like getting a computer science degree in the late 70’S /early 80’s; it was still a good field to study, but an electrical engineering degree would be just as useful (so I have heard, i was born in the 80’s and don't remember lol).I would say that if you’re looking for the best possible degree to get for data science/analytics, your best option would be to get a degree in computer science from MIT or other top ranked technology schools, and if they have a minor in stats, or analytics, add that on.Bonus info, if your considering analytics, learn R and Python now.

But mba in business analytics is not compulsory stuff, u can easily go for online courses from fab classes like simplilearn, jigsaw academy, edureka etc but in online mode u need to be very much self motivated and inspired by yourself as it is virtual mode so efforts put must be 10–15% more thane offline modes.Job scenerio:- Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional.

561,"Hi,Formal education and trainings are mandatory for starters. But mba in business analytics is not compulsory stuff, u can easily go for online courses from fab classes like simplilearn,edx, Coursera and udacity etc but in online mode u need to be very much self motivated and inspired by yourself as it is virtual mode so efforts put must be 10–15% more than offline modes, but if it is done in great passion it is by far best in cheap rate as well as u will get it in short span of period.Job scenerio:- Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional. Freshers might find tough to into analytics space so better is gain experience for 2-3yrs side by side start your learning and after some years, go for interview and Get into your analytics life.Salary as per analytics india magazine is as follows:-0-4years experienced folks with all knowledge of r, python, excel can earn upto 10-12lacs that too from big shot mncs whereas startups will give u around 5-8lacs depending upon the nature and status of the startup.Learning methodology:- It hardly takes 6months of practice with weekly commitment of around 4-5hrs is enough to atleast cover all big data analytics concepts like Hadoop, hbase, hive, sqoop, spark, pig, mapreduce, scala, Cassandra, mongodb, storm, kafka written in java or python... But actual used tools in major companies are Hadoop(getting obsolete because of top class spark which is same as Hadoop only reliability, speed, one to two concepts differs), Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, Pig,Hdfs, Mapreduce.Note:- Tools differs but Concepts are majorly drawn from old ones. Easy to learn Any tools but Getting handson on concepts and realizing the actual working of the concepts plays a vital role in analytics domain.I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets.Coming to the courses mentioning below check it:-There are many other options which are having less fees, quality education, rich content as per latest market scenerio.I feel so for recently launched online or off line pgp courses in business analytics @ Praxis bschool which has tieup with PwC and icici for online and full time course at bangalore and kolkata campud and in collaboration with IIDT at hyderabad campus in association with Hyderabad government. Even recently they have launched online courses on pg data science and business analytics for 8-12months duration, fees very less plus earn a degree from a aicte approved institute,placement support same as full time batch and every month one industry expert will come n take session via VLP.The course at praxis is very well structured and delivered and all are preferably for atleast 2yrs experienced folks but they are all distance learning courses via VLP mode. They are fabulous in their contents, facilities, faculties, support,brand..If you want to do pg then go and do it from praxis as they have launched recently enabled online course they are best by far less cost and rich contents with great placement support after 6months duration. Believe me placement is also there even for online course offered by praxis business school.Praxis has thrived hard to be the best in all terms whether it is online or offline specially in data science domain in india or in asia for providing cutting edges practices....Course in collaboration with Chennai based edu tech startup see their partner program page in praxis college website it will show you all mandatory details. Fees for full time is 5lacs but only in Bangalore and kolkata so those who want to learn from a very reputed bschool plus good placement assistance plus great faculty then praxis would ne far better and for online mode also fees is very less plus placement assistance is provided as per one preference.Websites like KAGGLE, AIM & AVIDHYA will help.Best business schools in analytics space in asia as per many sources :-Praxis business school(backed by icici and pwc experts) Great full time and online mode classesIIM-C + ISI-C + IIT-K(Immensely Best in all terms).. These two are by far best for full time as well as part time modeIIMS, ISB, PRAXIS,NMIMS are all great courses but my suggestion is to take courses from simplilearn or udacity or edx best in class content with affordable range.Countries Speacially in:-Best data analytics courses are available in india, usa, canada & Ireland...Choose wisely!!All d best!!Welcome to Data Driven World!!.","Answered Oct 13, 2018 · Author has 970 answers and 256.6k answer views",2,", lives in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India (1994-present)",https://www.quora.com/profile/Adarsh-Iyer-7,1,Adarsh Iyer,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-best-institutes-in-mumbai-for-data-analytics,55.0

You can opt online or classroom training at Imarticus Learning in Mumbai.All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. Data Analytics is one such profession where you need to have classroom experience as well. You can choose online training for the basics but you have to undergo classroom training for the advance part of it.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program over a course. As program is more purpose focused enlightening complete domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused where you can only upgrade limited number of skills. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence you going for a program would be recommendable.One should always go for a program which is onsite, instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data analytics.

571,"While I can talk about why Ivy Professional School is the best Data Analytics and Data Science institute with placement opportunities [1] and why it has been ranked among the top data science schools in the country (2014, 2015, 2016) by reputed AIM / SiliconIndia, I will focus on all the important parameters to judge an institute:Course Content & International Certifications - The most important aspect about any analytics course is the content it covers. A good short-term data science should ideally cover: 1) Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Visualization tools like SAS, R, Python, Excel, VBA, SQL, RDBMS, Tableau, etc. 2) Big Data Tools like - Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Mahout, etc.3) Basic to Advanced Statistical Modeling Concepts like - Linear / Logisitc Regression, Time Series, Decision Trees, Clustering, Random Forest, Optimization, etc.4) Machine Learning Concepts like - SVM, NLP, Parallel Computing, IR, Supervised / Un-supervised Learning, etc. Ivy’s Data Science / Analytics Certification Programs (with Machine Learning Add-on) cover all of the above and more. It also prepares you for theInternational Certifications from SAS, EMC2, Cloudera, Tableau, etc.Faculty Team - You want to join an institute to learn from the experiences of the faculty team (otherwise you can learn for free from YouTube). While judging a faculty team, you should ideally focus on: 1) Industry experience - An industry experienced faculty member could only bring relevant examples into training. 2) Education background - A faculty with strong education background could ensure solid theoretical understanding of the concepts for high quality training. 3) Training experience - Faculty should have had teaching experience to be able to connect with the students. Often industry experienced professionals, without any teaching experience, find it difficult to connect with the students. Ivy Professional School’s data science faculty team has 100+ years of industry experience with strong education background from IIM, IIT, ISI, US Universities, etc. They have strong teaching experience as well.Industry Connect - A strong and legitimate industry connect is important for content relevancy and placements. Be wary of any institute which says placement is guaranteed. Ivy Professional School is an official learning partner of large analytics companies like Genpact, HSBC, Capgemini, ICRA, Moody’s analytics, eBay/PayPal, Cognizant, etc. Ivy also has the experience of conducting multiple industry sponsored / joint-certification business analytics batches for companies like Genpact, Mu Sigma, Affine Analytics, etc. Ivy’s analytics / data science alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies.Experience - In education, experience of an institute matters as with time an institute learns / re-learns / evolves its course content, builds credibility among recruiters, refines its processes, etc. Also, with experience, an institute builds a strong alumni network, which helps significantly in placement process as well. Ivy Professional School was among the first institutes in India to launch analytics / data science programs. Ivy has been running analytics /data science programs since 2008.Past Placement Record - Past placement record can tell a lot about an institute’s performance and acceptability in the industry. Take the list of past alumni and verify on Linkedin. Ivy Professional School’s alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies [2]. Their profiles could be verified on LinkedIn. Click here to download the Ivy’s recently placed students.Alumni Testimonials - Review what institute’s alumni say about their experience with the institute. If possible, reach out to them. You can read Ivy Professional School’s alumni reviews here.Convenience to Learn Online or In-Class-Room near your home town / city - It could be very inconvenient to travel for short-term courses. Also, you may or may not be comfortable learning only online. Hence, look for an institute which could offer class-room as well as an online option. Ivy Professional School offers three modes of learning in various metros (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, etc.): 1) Class-room training option available in Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune (more cities coming soon) 2) Online - Live 3) Online - Self paced / recordedHaving said that, should you want to discuss anything related to analytics / data science or your profile, I’ll be more than happy to discuss that personally with you.Thanks,Prateek Agrawal | Co-founder | Ivy Professional School | Past experience in management consulting with Big 5 consulting firmsFootnotes[1] Analytics Certification Courses - R, SAS, Hadoop, Tableau | Big Data Certification | Ivy Pro School[2] http://ivyproschool.com/wp-conte...","Answered Jun 6, 2016",1,", Official Training partner to Genpact, Capgemini, ICRA & more",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivy-Professional-School-1,1,Ivy Professional School,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-institute-for-analytics,57.0

577,"Data Science is a vast field encapsulating Machine Learning, Big Data, Data Analytics and a lot more. Data Science is something which you could start learning online itself via MOOC’s and videos on YouTube, but the main issue you’ll face is proper guidance. As Data Science is a vast field it is very easy to be distracted and not know which path to take or how to proceed ahead. If you have a mentor who has experience in this field then you are good to go, if not then it’s time to gear up to find one.How to select an institute?Today’s world is based on a “me too” tactic, where whenever a new technology comes everybody jumps the bandwagon even though they themselves have no experience in it. You could simply take an example of NIIT classes who provide different courses in IT. The only reason why people join them is because of their legacy. Once you join it you would understand that they teach you just enough that you get a piece of paper from them - read certificate of completion. You won’t get a proper value for the money and time you invest. It is anytime better to go to an institute who has their vision streamlined and focussed on only a particular stack or technology.Since the start of 2017, I’ve been looking for a course in Data Science. I have experimented a lot with MOOC’s with not too impressive results, hence the search for a local institute. I shortlisted a couple of institutes and then started reviewing each one of them.Xavier’s Institute: I didn’t have much expectation from Xavier’s Institute as it was merely a college which was offering a degree. Just like undergrad degree, this didn’t seem to be worth it.Great Lakes: GreatLakes offers a wide range of PGDM courses but I found it to be focussed more on a single aspects like Business Analytics or Big DataGreyAtom: After months of searching for courses, I found GreyAtom’s course to be the best as it covered all the aspects of Data Science instead of just single aspects like Big Data or Analytics. I joined the course in May and have been loving it since then. The pro’s about this course is the chance to play with real data sets from their industry partners. Also it is way too practically oriented learning through which they replicate scenarios that we’ll face in the real world as Data Scientist. Another thing that I loved is that the cohort of students is simply amazing.All in all, after comparing many institutes like AnalyticsVidya, Upgrad, Xavier’s, Great Lakes, I’m happy to have chosen GreyAtomDisclaimer: I’m a student of GreyatomIf you have any questions then hit me up anytime via saiprasad.io","Answered Sep 21, 2017",0,", lives in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",https://www.quora.com/profile/Saiprasad-Balasubramanian-1,0,Saiprasad Balasubramanian,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-institute-for-Data-Science-GreyAtom-Great-Lakes-or-Xavier-Institute-in-Mumbai,61.0
578,"I would always recommend data science aspirants to go for a program which is classroom based , instructor led and heavily practice driven .You will come across a lot of institutions, courses, programs that will help you learn data science. Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while you are enrolling for such courses is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an institution/courseEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAnd in my opinion, Certifications are a proof that you have completed a course or a program and not a proof for what you have done. You must have read a lot of articles about educated unemployment or even come across some personal experiences wherein many students have masters degree but still are jobless!Why so?Well, because there is a huge skill gap between what industry wants and what’s in supply. Education system to a large extent has become a business game of just selling certificates. Therefore, it is not always necessary to rely on certifications. Theoretical information can be imparted easily. But what matters is the IMPLEMENTATION !We recently launched GreyAtom, an immersive learning program for engineers with our flagship program in Data Science. We are bringing classroom based learning with the strong online component to ensure the quality of the program.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education — We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program. Our focus is on building stuff and NOT CERTIFICATION.Focus on Industry Readiness — Our focus is on making our student’s industry ready. Our training platform “Commit.live” helps students build their profile on relevant platforms (GitHub, StackOverflow, Tech Blog) which are far more valuable than any certifications.Real Office Environment — We want to go away from classic “Coaching Institute” mentality. We want to mimic real industry experience throughout the program. Students will be working in an office environment.Quality EcoSystem — Our program is designed by the mix of industry practitioners and academician. All our instructors are people with hands-on experience and who have built some kick-ass stuff. We have an interview process before we enroll a student. Idea is to build qualitative ecosystem of experts and enthusiasts.Our Data Science ProgramWe have a separate track for freshers and working professionals. For freshers, there is a significant pre-work required before the start of the program.We have designed our program by interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. We also take continuous feedback from our premium community of data scientists (www.meetup.com/DataGiri/) which is now 4000 members strong.We already have some great industry partners on board with some really cool problem statements. Please visit an industry project section on our program page to get more details — Full Stack Data Science Engineering | GreyatomWe want to ensure that you should be able to write production-grade data science applications by end of the program. We cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.For the fact, India produces the highest number of engineering in the world and over 80% of them are unemployable. We are here to change that.Just to conclude, do not think GreyAtom as any other course, that’s not what we are trying to build. It’s an eco-system which helps improve industry readiness and quality of engineers.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career. Students built projects upon REAL DataSet and Problem Statements provided by our industry and hiring partners. Program is classroom based and heavily practice driven.

584,"I'm Mitul Thakkar one of the founders of GreyAtom. Thank you for inviting me to answer this question.Our program is suitable for freshers as well as working professionals. However, in this response, I will try to keep my discussion around freshers.Let me start with my background:I've completed BE from Mumbai University and then MS in Computer Science from SUNY Binghamton (New York). I have worked with corporate in India and then have worked with Yahoo! in Sunnyvale, Bay area. I have experience working and studying in India as well as in the US.After my stint with Yahoo! I moved to India to build my startup Customer360, which eventually got acquired by Interactive Intelligence (NASDAQ: ININ)During Customer360 I and my co-founder Mayuresh Shilotri (IIT-M Graduate) went through the biggest pain of our life - to build a quality engineering team. It took us a lot of time to build engineering talent. During the process of building the team & interviewing freshers/working professionals, we learned a lot of things - some of them are listed below:Problem with existing Eco-SystemEngineering education is too theoretical. We waste 3 to 4 years to get a degree which hardly adds any industry knowledge. I faced the same situation 10 years back when I graduated - Unfortunately, it’s still the same.Most of the Private Institutes are in the business of selling certification. They pick buzz words like Data Science, Digital Marketing etc. and make money in the name of certification.Most of the engineers are still away from real industry tools and practices (test driven development, code versioning, pair programming, working with cloud etc).We still follow stupid rules like - you need 60% aggregate to participate in campus placement. Because of such rules, students are crazy to score percentage rather than gaining some real knowledge.After the acquisition of my previous company Customer360 & some break, we planned to start up again. We started thinking about the same problem - ""How can we bring quality to the engineering?"" and GreyAtom was born.Core Principles and Differentiator of GreyAtomPractice-Based Education - We want students to work on real tools and real world problems during the program.

585,"There are 3 parts in your question.Gray Atom’s Course:Despite of the claims that institutes make about their courses, they all deliver you the same story.In the name of real-world project and hands-on experience, they give you the same age old task to do, which is of no use when it actually comes to work in a client project in any organization.Enrolling as a fresher:I would suggest not to join such courses as a fresher. I would be of great help if you get business experience for around 2 years and then get into these stuffs.

586,"I have helped many learn Analtyics and get placed both in their company and outside their company. Here are my observations on how to select an online learning course that fits your need. Online learning in Analtyics - is better in my experience than offline learning as the best corporates dont teach in physical local institutes anymore.Ask some simple questions to know if the online learning course fits your need. I have a lot of respect for all sites like Grey Atom, Equiskill. com, Acadguild, Simplilearn and they all have some positives and it depends on what is your need and how their strengths align with your needs.Join a free analtyics webinar this weekend to learn more.How many people does an online course have in a class?Very important. Should be less than 25 for sure. Some have 30 + in a batch and you will find it hard to get answers to individual questions. I maintain less than 25 per batch at Equiskill as a rule. Unfortunately some have 60+ students in a batch which is super hard both for the teacher and the learners. This is a very important consideration and question to ask directly.How much quality experience do the instructors have ?Should be 10 + years in MNC Corporates in Analytics or related fields and at progressively senior levels. I was a VP in Analytics and my instructors are Senior Managers in Analytics in top 4 financial institutions in the world. Our faculty are from ISB and have experience in Amazon, American express analtyics, HSBC, IBM Watson and more.Lesson is you should ask directly who is the faculty and why you should learn from them.What career assistance can you expect?I provide 1:1 Analytics Resume writing support to each learner that requests it so they at least get interview calls. For the best in the batch who performed well in all assignments we have forwarded their resume, they got calls, interviews, some got placed some did not. The point is before the course they were dreaming of an analytics career. After the course it got better. Read this feedback on Quora on Equiskill and one more specific feedback pertinent to you. You must also read this one on Acadguild as well. Likewise please research all and take your decision.Can I get a top-up class on a new topic to prepare for an interview?You may need a top up class on SAS Macros, or Advanced Forecasting to prepare for an interview where you have been shortlisted. They should help at a nominal cost.For how long will the recordings and LMS access be granted?We provide at least two years access.Can I attend again if I miss a class?Equiskill provides free flexi-pass for next batch. So you can catch up on videos of live in case you miss a class.Will I get a relevant Capstone project?Be aware of the project you will get so that it aligns with your career goals. A project in Healthcare will not help you if you apply for Banking analytics jobs.I hope this helps Mihir!","Answered Dec 19, 2017 · Author has 432 answers and 569.7k answer views",2,", worked at Amazon",https://www.quora.com/profile/Amit-Upadhyay-104,2,Amit Upadhyay,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-reviews-of-Grey-Atoms-data-science-course-Is-it-worth-taking-it-as-a-fresher-Do-they-provide-placements,63.0

Their program is the result of inputs from interviewing 50+ Data Science heads of various companies. The content is industry focused, but they approach teaching by having students work on real Data Sets on their In-House learning platform Commit.Live that is integrated with GitHub. And this makes your portfolio strong. Apart from this, they organize meetups, webinars, and hackathons. Also, they nurture you from the basics to get your every aspect of Data Science enhanced to professional Data Science level. They don’t provide placements but yes, they organize hackathons where you can showcase your skills to relevant industry partners.Coming to your questions.With regard to course, Yes. It is worth taking it as a recent graduate since they have separate tracks for recent graduates and working professionals. Recent graduates need significant groundwork before they enroll.Content: They cover end to end cycle of data science application which starts from the foundation (Python / Data Science) and ends with cloud deployment on AWS and scaling your Data Science app.Placements: They don’t get you a job, but they do assist you with placements by enhancing your soft skills and organizing hackathons where you can not only showcase your skills to relevant industry partners but also get your chances of getting hired way higher.Disclaimer: I am Bhavesh Bhatt, Data Scientist at Flexiloans and I was a student at GreyAtom, June 2017 Batch.

591,"Hi,Formal education and trainings are mandatory for starters. But mba in business analytics is not compulsory stuff, u can easily go for online courses from fab classes like simplilearn,edx, Coursera and udacity etc but in online mode u need to be very much self motivated and inspired by yourself as it is virtual mode so efforts put must be 10–15% more than offline modes, but if it is done in great passion it is by far best in cheap rate as well as u will get it in short span of period.Job scenerio:- Jobs are immense once you become 2years experienced professional. Freshers might find tough to into analytics space so better is gain experience for 2-3yrs side by side start your learning and after some years, go for interview and Get into your analytics life.Salary as per analytics india magazine is as follows:-0-4years experienced folks with all knowledge of r, python, excel can earn upto 10-12lacs that too from big shot mncs whereas startups will give u around 5-8lacs depending upon the nature and status of the startup.Learning methodology:- It hardly takes 6months of practice with weekly commitment of around 4-5hrs is enough to atleast cover all big data analytics concepts like Hadoop, hbase, hive, sqoop, spark, pig, mapreduce, scala, Cassandra, mongodb, storm, kafka written in java or python... But actual used tools in major companies are Hadoop(getting obsolete because of top class spark which is same as Hadoop only reliability, speed, one to two concepts differs), Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, Pig,Hdfs, Mapreduce.Note:- Tools differs but Concepts are majorly drawn from old ones. Easy to learn Any tools but Getting handson on concepts and realizing the actual working of the concepts plays a vital role in analytics domain.I would suggest you to first learn by doing, go for internships in a startups to gain lots of exposure in all aspects of technologies and real world issues and them jump onto big mncs with your wider skillsets.Coming to the courses mentioning below check it:-There are many other options which are having less fees, quality education, rich content as per latest market scenerio.I feel so for recently launched online or off line pgp courses in business analytics @ Praxis bschool which has tieup with PwC and icici for online and full time course at bangalore and kolkata campud and in collaboration with IIDT at hyderabad campus in association with Hyderabad government. Even recently they have launched online courses on pg data science and business analytics for 8-12months duration, fees very less plus earn a degree from a aicte approved institute,placement support same as full time batch and every month one industry expert will come n take session via VLP.The course at praxis is very well structured and delivered and all are preferably for atleast 2yrs experienced folks but they are all distance learning courses via VLP mode. They are fabulous in their contents, facilities, faculties, support,brand..If you want to do pg then go and do it from praxis as they have launched recently enabled online course they are best by far less cost and rich contents with great placement support after 6months duration. Believe me placement is also there even for online course offered by praxis business school.Praxis has thrived hard to be the best in all terms whether it is online or offline specially in data science domain in india or in asia for providing cutting edges practices....Course in collaboration with Chennai based edu tech startup see their partner program page in praxis college website it will show you all mandatory details. Fees for full time is 5lacs but only in Bangalore and kolkata so those who want to learn from a very reputed bschool plus good placement assistance plus great faculty then praxis would ne far better and for online mode also fees is very less plus placement assistance is provided as per one preference.Websites like KAGGLE, AIM & AVIDHYA will help.Best business schools in analytics space in asia as per many sources :-Praxis business school(backed by icici and pwc experts) Great full time and online mode classesIIM-C + ISI-C + IIT-K(Immensely Best in all terms).. These two are by far best for full time as well as part time modeIIMS, ISB, PRAXIS,NMIMS are all great courses but my suggestion is to take courses from simplilearn or udacity or edx best in class content with affordable range.Apart these all r okay like great lakes, aegis, spjain, manipal, misb,nmims no placements assistance n very high fees with less options to get placed.Countries Speacially in:-Best data analytics courses are available in india, usa, canada & Ireland...Choose wisely!!All d best!!Welcome to Data Driven World!!.","Answered Sep 25, 2018 · Author has 970 answers and 256.6k answer views",2,", lives in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India (1994-present)",https://www.quora.com/profile/Adarsh-Iyer-7,3,Adarsh Iyer,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-better-institute-for-data-analytics-and-data-science-Great-Lakes-or-Aegis-in-Mumbai,64.0

631,"While I can talk about why Ivy Professional School is the best Data Analytics and Data Science institute with placement opportunities [1] in Bangalore (and other cities) and why it has been ranked among the top data science schools in the country (2014, 2015, 2016) by reputed AIM / SiliconIndia, I will focus on all the important parameters to judge an institute:Course Content & International Certifications - The most important aspect about any analytics course is the content it covers. A good short-term data science should ideally cover: 1) Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Visualization toolslike SAS, R, Python, Excel, VBA, SQL, RDBMS, Tableau, etc. 2) Big Data Tools like - Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Mahout, etc.3) Basic to Advanced Statistical Modeling Concepts like - Linear / Logisitc Regression, Time Series, Decision Trees, Clustering, Random Forest, Optimization, etc.4) Machine Learning Concepts like - SVM, NLP, Parallel Computing, IR, Supervised / Un-supervised Learning, etc. Ivy’s Data Science / Analytics Certification Programs (with Machine Learning Add-on) cover all of the above and more. It also prepares you for theInternational Certifications from SAS, EMC2, Cloudera, Tableau, etc.Faculty Team - You want to join an institute to learn from the experiences of the faculty team (otherwise you can learn for free from YouTube). While judging a faculty team, you should ideally focus on: 1) Industry experience - An industry experienced faculty member could only bring relevant examples into training. 2) Education background - A faculty with strong education background could ensure solid theoretical understanding of the concepts for high quality training. 3) Training experience - Faculty should have had teaching experience to be able to connect with the students. Often industry experienced professionals, without any teaching experience, find it difficult to connect with the students. Ivy Professional School’s data science faculty team has 100+ years of industry experience with strong education background from IIM, IIT, ISI, US Universities, etc. They have strong teaching experience as well.Industry Connect - A strong and legitimate industry connect is important for content relevancy and placements. Be wary of any institute which says placement is guaranteed. Ivy Professional School is an official learning partner of large analytics companies like Genpact, HSBC, Capgemini, ICRA, Moody’s analytics, eBay/PayPal, Cognizant, etc. Ivy also has the experience of conducting multiple industry sponsored / joint-certification business analytics batches for companies like Genpact, Mu Sigma, Affine Analytics, etc. Ivy’s analytics / data science alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies.Experience - In education, experience of an institute matters as with time an institute learns / re-learns / evolves its course content, builds credibility among recruiters, refines its processes, etc. Also, with experience, an institute builds a strong alumni network, which helps significantly in placement process as well. Ivy Professional School was among the first institutes in India to launch analytics / data science programs. Ivy has been running analytics /data science programs since 2008.Past Placement Record - Past placement record can tell a lot about an institute’s performance and acceptability in the industry. Take the list of past alumni and verify on Linkedin. Ivy Professional School’s alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies[2]. Their profiles could be verified on LinkedIn. Click here to download Ivy’s recently placed students list.Alumni Testimonials - Review what institute’s alumni say about their experience with the institute. If possible, reach out to them. You can read Ivy Professional School’s alumni reviews here.Convenience to Learn Online or In-Class-Room near your home town / city - It could be very inconvenient to travel for short-term courses. Also, you may or may not be comfortable learning only online. Hence, look for an institute which could offer class-room as well as an online option. Ivy Professional School offers three modes of learning in various metros (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, etc.): 1) Class-room training option available in Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune (more cities coming soon) 2) Online - Live 3) Online - Self paced / recordedHaving said that, should you want to discuss anything related to analytics / data science or your profile, I’ll be more than happy to discuss that personally with you.Thanks,Prateek Agrawal | Co-founder | Ivy Professional School | Past experience in management consulting with Big 5 consulting firmsFootnotes[1] Analytics Certification Courses - R, SAS, Hadoop, Tableau | Big Data Certification | Ivy Pro School[2] http://ivyproschool.com/wp-conte...","Answered Jun 6, 2016",1,", Official Training partner to Genpact, Capgemini, ICRA & more",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivy-Professional-School-1,0,Ivy Professional School,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-good-training-institute-for-big-data-analytics-in-Bangalore,71.0

So I would join a free Analytics Introductory webinar from home. There are so many happening like this one here on Saturday 16th December 7:30 PM IST.Also, after that you can consider the Analytics Accelerator Certification by Equiskill rated 4.9 on 5 by learners. Its a great starting point and covers Data Analytics in R & Tableau. It is taught by Corporate VP’s in Analytics and Corporate Senior Managers in Analytics both in Fortune 100 companies. Not just trainers. the best part is the individual 1:1 resume assistance people get and the live project they get.There is also Simplilearn, Edureka they are quite good in terms of faculty profile of corporates who teach. with the only problem being that sometimes they can fill 50+ learners in one class so no one gets adequate individual attention.I teach personally and love to help my students. I can almost never do it if I fill more than 25 learners in a class so be aware of that.Learn for Corporates not just trainers. Corporates can mentor you and will act as a network to help you get a job. Trainers will not.There are many physical training institutes but do not waste time (they charge more for less quality, and money travelling to learn there. The best corporate trainers do not go to physical class, they are only open to teaching from home online.One final word - PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE everything you learn in class.

639,"Since 2013, Big Data scene in India has really flourished. Awareness among working professionals, freshers and undergrads is on rise.. Job opportunities is increasing at a great pace.Seeing this there are many institutes offering data science courses online or onsite ( classroom model).All skills are basically divided into two categories, ones that can be learnt online and ones that can only be learnt in a classroom model. In my personal opinion you can learn how to play a guitar by following an online video, whereas having all the materials available online to become a doctor, you still cannot become a doctor watching videos. I personally equate Data Analytics with practitioner centric profession like doctor etc.I personally believe in learning by doing. Hence would always recommend a program more than a course. As program is more purpose focused on building domain knowledge whereas a course is more tool focused. Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated. Hence going for a program is recommended .You must have already googled and come across plethora of institutes offering data analytics courses.Some are way expensive while some are reasonable. But, one very important thing to keep in mind while enrolling is to know the worth of it in terms of knowledge and what at the end of the course you are developing within yourself.Some points to consider while choosing an programEmphasis is more on practice and not just theory.Project is based on industry relevant problem statements and not the age old assignmentsLearnings and Projects are collaborative and performed in teamsYou get real industry tools and focus is on test driven developmentAlso your program should ideally include the topics mentioned below in order to deliver a complete package.Basics of R & Python programmingExploratory Data Analysis with Excel, RLinear Regression, its variations and Industry ProjectDecision Trees, Ensemble & ClassificationClusteringTime Series RegressionData Bases & Big Data EcosystemData Visualization, story telling, dashboarding, TableauBuilding production scale big data products and their deploymentBig Data Engineering, Deep Learning & Tensor Flow, NLPDisclaimer: I am a co-founder @GreyAtom, assisting engineering talents find sustainable careers in emerging technologies.GreyAtom’s highly selective flagship program aims at mentoring working professional and freshers in kickstarting their Data Science career.

I realized Big data is very vast & I'm spending too much unnecessary time going into blogs & unnecessary details and was also worried about what I would write in my resume for real-time big data project.Fortunately, I had got ABC For Technology- Highly Experienced BigData IIT professional who was also working in the top MNC & was taking Hadoop big data classes exclusively on the weekends.

So, individual staff members are responsible for their own training in their own time. Embrace continuous learning and build a DevOps lab.The following DevOps lab runs with a single laptop and a series of free tools. With my infrastructure background, I have laid out the exercises and trials to help you learn DevOps from the infrastructure side of things, rather than the developer side. These steps introduce infrastructure and operational concepts, such as immutable infrastructure, configuration automation and containerization.The simplest home lab is a single computer -- quite possibly a gaming computerthat serves double duty. The DevOps lab requires a reasonably powerful workstation, with a multicore CPU and at least 8 GB of RAM. A solid-state drive is required for a serious home lab. The DevOps lab itself runs on virtual machines on top of the host PC. And you want as much automation as possible. It should be easy to recreate the lab after a mistake, and just as easy to start or stop the lab in a few minutes.To learn DevOps most effectively, use its principles to build this lab. A build process delivers an immutable infrastructure, which is described in some files. This manner of constructing an IT deployment is called infrastructure as code. A version control system protects and manages these code files. In the following steps, I'll demonstrate how to use files pulled from my GitHub repository.Follow along with the DevOps lab setup in four parts:1. Start here to install HashiCorp Vagrant and spin up the Linux virtual machines that comprise the home lab with a consistent workflow.2. Move on to pick up Git version control techniques, describing your infrastructure to allow repeatable deployments and controlled change.3. Next, install Ansible so you can configure VMs more easily using automation instead of manual effort.4. Now you're ready to spin up Docker containers and discover this new layer of abstraction for production workloads.The lab we build today is not the end; it's a starting point for more DevOps learning. Use the lab to dig deeper into configuration management capabilities or as a basis to learn about Kubernetes or Mesos container orchestration platforms, for example.Join the DiscussionNext StepsPlethora of DevOps tools has ops teams seeking orderThe skills to land DevOps engineer jobsWhat to call IT ops in the DevOps futureHere is The Video On What is DevOps ?Here is the Video On DevOps Interview Preparation Stages ?Here is the Video On DevOps Course Content need to be fallowed.Here is the DevOps Demo Session Video :The weeds are very tool specific.

Here are few tips I can help with:Before making the decision to choose trainer/institute/companies give focus on the trainer profile/current role and responsibility if he is working professional or not, his relevant experience in the subject.Choose you mentor wisely, if trainer is providing only classes but doesn’t have real time exposure on the subject then there are chances you are won’t get satisfy from the training.Give time to demonstration classes from trainers. After the demonstration classes you get to know trainer content delivery, Study Material they provide and most importantly trainer knowledge on the subject.Testimonial of the trainers or feedback from the previous students. This is very important. You can get details easily from them.Post Training support from the trainer/organization is also very important. Please check whether trainer provide it or not.Focus on the projects in the syllabus, trainer is covering the class or not. Without project understanding you do not get the complete end to end integration of the subject.backup of the missed classes or revision sessions post training.Fees structure, though it is not very important to find the right person. but important for the pocket.Batch timings, make sure there are no changes in the timings, usually institute provide morning batches and later shifted to evening.Number of students in a batch, again not very important but mid size batches help one to one interaction with the trainer.Hope my tips help to find out the right place.

702,"If not anything else, you must have at least heard the word Java & Testing. No wonder it does not require any separate introduction.Some major characteristics of Java are- it is object-oriented, class-based and concurrent.It is known to have very few execution dependencies that make it the first choice for a variety of applications all over the world. Not to tell differently that it is amongst the most widely used programming languages. What developers’ like the most is the fact that it has the principle of write once, run anywhere. This means that a Java code post compilation can run on all platforms. No need to recompile time and again.

703,"While I can talk about why Ivy Professional School is the best Data Analytics and Data Science institute with placement opportunities [1] and why it has been ranked among the top data science schools in the country (2014, 2015, 2016) by reputed AIM / SiliconIndia, I will focus on all the important parameters to judge an institute:Course Content & International Certifications - The most important aspect about any analytics course is the content it covers. A good short-term data science should ideally cover: 1) Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Data Visualization toolslike SAS, R, Python, Excel, VBA, SQL, RDBMS, Tableau, etc. 2) Big Data Tools like - Hadoop, Scala, Spark, Mahout, etc.3) Basic to Advanced Statistical Modeling Concepts like - Linear / Logisitc Regression, Time Series, Decision Trees, Clustering, Random Forest, Optimization, etc.4) Machine Learning Concepts like - SVM, NLP, Parallel Computing, IR, Supervised / Un-supervised Learning, etc. Ivy’s Data Science / Analytics Certification Programs (with Machine Learning Add-on) cover all of the above and more. It also prepares you for theInternational Certifications from SAS, EMC2, Cloudera, Tableau, etc.Faculty Team - You want to join an institute to learn from the experiences of the faculty team (otherwise you can learn for free from YouTube). While judging a faculty team, you should ideally focus on: 1) Industry experience - An industry experienced faculty member could only bring relevant examples into training. 2) Education background - A faculty with strong education background could ensure solid theoretical understanding of the concepts for high quality training. 3) Training experience - Faculty should have had teaching experience to be able to connect with the students. Often industry experienced professionals, without any teaching experience, find it difficult to connect with the students. Ivy Professional School’s data science faculty team has 100+ years of industry experience with strong education background from IIM, IIT, ISI, US Universities, etc. They have strong teaching experience as well.Industry Connect - A strong and legitimate industry connect is important for content relevancy and placements. Be wary of any institute which says placement is guaranteed. Ivy Professional School is an official learning partner of large analytics companies like Genpact, HSBC, Capgemini, ICRA, Moody’s analytics, eBay/PayPal, Cognizant, etc. Ivy also has the experience of conducting multiple industry sponsored / joint-certification business analytics batches for companies like Genpact, Mu Sigma, Affine Analytics, etc. Ivy’s analytics / data science alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies.Experience - In education, experience of an institute matters as with time an institute learns / re-learns / evolves its course content, builds credibility among recruiters, refines its processes, etc. Also, with experience, an institute builds a strong alumni network, which helps significantly in placement process as well. Ivy Professional School was among the first institutes in India to launch analytics / data science programs. Ivy has been running analytics /data science programs since 2008.Past Placement Record - Past placement record can tell a lot about an institute’s performance and acceptability in the industry. Take the list of past alumni and verify on Linkedin. Ivy Professional School’s alumni are working with 75+ analytics companies[2]. Their profiles could be verified on LinkedIn. Click here to download Ivy’s recently placed students list.Alumni Testimonials - Review what institute’s alumni say about their experience with the institute. If possible, reach out to them. You can read Ivy Professional School’s alumni reviews here.Convenience to Learn Online or In-Class-Room near your home town / city - It could be very inconvenient to travel for short-term courses. Also, you may or may not be comfortable learning only online. Hence, look for an institute which could offer class-room as well as an online option. Ivy Professional School offers three modes of learning in various metros (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Pune, etc.): 1) Class-room training option available in Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune (more cities coming soon) 2) Online - Live 3) Online - Self paced / recordedHaving said that, should you want to discuss anything related to analytics / data science or your profile, I’ll be more than happy to discuss that personally with you.Thanks,Prateek Agrawal | Co-founder | Ivy Professional School | Past experience in management consulting with Big 5 consulting firmsFootnotes[1] Analytics Certification Courses - R, SAS, Hadoop, Tableau | Big Data Certification | Ivy Pro School[2] http://ivyproschool.com/wp-conte...","Answered Jun 6, 2016",1,", Official Training partner to Genpact, Capgemini, ICRA & more",https://www.quora.com/profile/Ivy-Professional-School-1,0,Ivy Professional School,https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-training-institute-for-big-data-analytics-with-job-placement-in-Lucknow,90.0
704,"Hi, there are two parts to the question - Learning and Placement Learning Analytics  I know Lucknow well and would not recommend smaller institutes to learn Big data. The best option for people in Cities like Indore, Nagpur, Lucknow etc. is to join some of the good courses online for the learning. There are many sites like Coursera with recorded classes as well as many live classes on the internet where you can interact with faculty. All you need is a 1 mbps internet connection or 3G dongle and the willingness to learn. Placement in Analytics Once you have learnt analytics you need a job there are all the websites where you can apply Hiree, Facebook pages and more. It would help to have a certification in area of interest like Base SAS or Tableau if you target specific companies. Again the chances of placement increase if you do a full time MBA or full one year degree in Analytics. But not every one can leave their job or home town and invest lakhs of rupees so I advise people to learn online first before investing in a heavy course like ISB or Great Lakes.

710,"Data Analytics is the two words domain which seems one solution to this field whereas whenever it comes to work in data analytics. Majorly it is divided into 3 parts. Refer below image for quick reference.Now after referring above image you need to decide where you want yourself to be placed.Data Analyst is the person who is having mastery in managing data. They are doctors of data and are capable to easily handle the data. They work on analytics softwares like SAS, Python or R depending on the client requirement.Data Scientists are the people who have mastery about statistics. They know that how to get findings from data by applying the statistics. Data Scientists take data prepared by the data analysts.Data Visualization guys are the master to attract the user by make the eye catchy and easily usable dashboards or reports of the task completed by the Data Scientists. They also play very crucial role as you might have heard one saying “Knowledge is useless if we do not know how to represent our knowledge” Same thing is applied here too.Now to enter into the industry most of the companies usually ask for people who have knowledge of analytics tools (SAS, R and Python) and visualization tool like Tableau and one not the least and one and only Excel as well :).Now you may have get idea that what you need to learn.Now let’s talk about the institutesI would say that do not ask the best institutes because everybody say I am the best whereas You need to decide which is best for you.You need to consider below points before going to any institute because you need to be comfortable before starting learning anything.Course contents covered by the institutes because most the the institutes have limited contents. Some teach SAS Base, some teach SAS Advance and some teach the SAS complete package.Now you need to think what fee institutes are charging for the course selected by you. Whether your pocket allow you to join the institute or not. do the fee vs content comparison because you need to learn the best at lowest fee therefore you need to search for the best option which meet your requirement. Like some institutes say we charge 20k fee whereas at the time of buying same they will ask you service tax extra as well ;).Now you need to take the demo class from the institutes which you have selected in your list. And judge whether you are understanding the class because it is going to impact your knowledge base which will help you to crack interview. Some institutes take token money before giving you the demo class then you can judge that it is like they do not believe their content so that you will not go back to them. They say that token money is refundable if they think that they can return the money then why they are taking money because you will have to follow up with them incase you do not like the course ;).Never stick to only one option that i will learn only face to face or online class because anything can be better. It completely depends on the instructor how he is teach and knowledge level of instructor and easy way to explanation as well. Because we know that “Knowledge is useless if we do not know how to represent our knowledge”Last and most important thing. Kindly have patience because sometimes you will think that how long it will take to finish it whereas with time we achieve everything with right path. You have found the right path till point 4 and now you need to start learning with true dedication.Let me tell you one option where you can learn to enter into analytics industry.You can call us to get your queries resolved. Do not hesitate to get the right path for learning your dream skill.Above mentioned fee includes service tax as well.You can watch free demo without paying any token money as well to your comfort level.","Answered Jun 3, 2017 · Author has 294 answers and 184.3k answer views",1,", worked at SAS",https://www.quora.com/profile/Vikas-Kumar-1515,3,Vikas Kumar,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-best-institute-in-India-to-learn-data-analytics,91.0
711,"First understand what your requirement is. Its a trade off I would say and everyone has different requirements.Are you looking for a brand name tag ? If yes choose any reputed Bschool ( but they are costly)Are you short of money ? All colleges will charge a lot. If money is a constraint and you can do a trade off, look for alternate sources.( but you wont get brand name on your CV)Are you looking for knowledge in this field and applying for a job ? Alternate sources are there for this such as :-Goooooogle — everything is there.MOOCs- Coursera, edX etc — but these arent that much reputed as Bschools are and plenty of people are going for these. So adding them on your CV wouldnt add that much value.Self Learning through books and blogsGuided Mentoring - This is the best way if you can get a mentor who can guide you what you should study and what you shouldnt. What you should study -everyone can tell but what you shouldnt study only an experienced person can guide you. Thereby helping you not to waste your time in Googling or going through so many courses and saving your money on the expensive courses. Its an overall win win situation. I myself mentor a lot of people and they are able to get into analytics in 3–6 months of time.Do a mix of the above and you are good !Make a decision as per your situation and requirement!

It’s well-structured and easy to interpret. I think that learning the basics of SQL for Data Analysis can be done in around 15 to 20 hours.If you want to learn then this article can help you out: SQL for Data Analysis ep#1.PythonPython is an easy programming language to take up as its very easy to interpret it and also to learn.

You can look at this link: Learn Bash for Data Analysis ep #1RR is quite similar to Python just has a steep learning curve. It can be a bit difficult to take this language up but once you learn, you will realize its advanced use in complicated statistical tasks in the field of data analysis for visualizations.Data VisualizationThis is the most important aspect in this field, because analysis is all about how you visualize the data.Here is a list of actions we typically need to perform in data analysis:Gather and transform the dataSpecify a model and/or a query from the dataSpecify how to represent the resultsBrowse the resultsSynthesize and communicate the facts gathered.Some books you can refer to:The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R.TufteInformation Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data by Stephen FewEnvisioning Information by Edward R.

Opting for a course is often seen to meet a short term goal because as the tools get updated your skill gets outdated.

As marketing research continues to enlarge, data analytics only has one way to go in the industry – up. Methods of gathering data have increased as accessing technology requires information in exchange. Here are some examples:Let’s start learning Big Data and Hadoop course and its some course content overview:Big Data: Big data and Hadoop course is a phrase that describes the massive quantity of information -- both unstructured and structured -- that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. Nevertheless, it's not exactly the quantity of information that is important. It's exactly what organizations do with all the information that matters. Big data could be examined for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business movements.While the expression ""big data"" is relatively new, the act of gathering and storing considerable quantities of information for ultimate analysis is ages old.What includes in Big data and Hadoop Course?Velocity. Data flows in at an unprecedented speed and has to be dealt with in a timely way. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the requirement to bargain with torrents of information in near-real time.Volume. Organizations collect information from a variety of resources, including business transactions, social media and information from detector or machine-to-machine data. In years past storing it would have been an issue -- but new technologies (for instance, Hadoop) have eased the weight.Variability. Daily, seasonal and event-triggered summit data heaps could be challenging to handle. More so with unstructured information.Variety. Data comes in all kinds of formats -- from organized, numeric information in traditional databases to unstructured text files, email, video, audio, stock ticker information and financial transactions.Complexity. Today's information comes from multiple sources, which makes it difficult to link, game, cleanse and transform information across programs. But it's crucial to link and socialize relationships, hierarchies and multiple information linkages or your information can quickly spiral out of control.Why Techstack as Best Big Data and Hadoop Course?Techstack has more than 500 reviews in google with 4.9 ratings in Big Data and Hadoop training.What is HadoopHadoop is a open source framework from Apache and is used to store procedure and analyze information which are extremely enormous in volume. Additionally it may be scaled up by simply adding nodes in the cluster.Google published its newspaper GFS and on the basis of the HDFS was designed. It says that the files will be broken up into blocks and stored in nodes within the distributed architecture.Yarn: Another Resource Negotiator is utilized for task scheduling and manage the audience.Program Reduce: This is a frame which helps Java apps to perform the concurrent computation on information using key value pair. The log activity takes input information and converts it into a data collection which may be calculated in Essential value pair. The outcome signal of Map task is absorbed by decrease task and then the outside of reducer gives the desired outcome.Hadoop Common: All these Java libraries are utilized to begin Hadoop and are utilized by additional Hadoop modules.Benefits of Hadoop in Big Data and Hadoop trainingQuick: In HDFS the information distributed within the bunch and therefore are mapped which assists in quicker retrieval. The tools to process the information tend to be on the very same servers, thus reducing the processing time. It is ready to process terabytes of information in minutes and Peta bytes in hours.Scalable: Hadoop bunch can be extended by simply adding nodes in the cluster.Resilient to failure: HDFS gets the land with which it may replicate data over the network, therefore if one node is down or another network failure occurs, then Hadoop chooses the other backup of information and utilize it. Usually, data are replicated thrice however, the replication factor is configurable.]YARN: Part of this core Hadoop undertaking, YARN is the architectural centre of Hadoop that lets multiple information processing engines like interactive SQL, real-time streaming, information science and batch processing to deal with data stored in a single platform, unlocking an entirely new approach to analytics.YARN is the foundation of the new generation of Hadoop and is enabling organizations everywhere to realize that a contemporary data architecture.YARN is the prerequisite for Enterprise Hadoop, providing resource management along with a fundamental platform to deliver consistent operations, security, and information governance tools across Hadoop clusters.YARN additionally extends the power of Hadoop to incumbent and new technologies located within the information centre so that they are able to benefit from cost effective, linear-scale storage and processing. It provides ISVs and developers a consistent framework for writing data access applications that operate IN Hadoop.What is HDFS in Big Data and Hadoop training?Hadoop comes with a distributed file system named HDFS. In HDFS information is distributed over many machines and replicated to make sure their durability to failure and high availability to concurrent application.It is cost effective because it uses commodity hardware. It involves the concept of cubes, information nodes and node name.Where to utilize HDFSVery Big Files: Files must be of countless megabytes, gigabytes or more.Streaming Data accessibility: The time to browse entire data collection is more important than latency in reading the first.Where not to utilize HDFSLow Latency data accessibility: Applications that require very less time to get the first data shouldn't utilize HDFS since it is giving importance to entire data as opposed to time to bring the first document.Plenty of Little Files:The title node contains the metadata of files in memory and if the files are small in size it requires a whole lot of memory for title node's memory which is not feasible.Multiple Writes:It shouldn't be used if we need to write multiple times.HDFS Concepts in Big Data and Hadoop training?Blocks: A Block is the minimum number of information that it may read or write.HDFS cubes are 128 MB by default and this is configurable.Files n HDFS are broken up into block-sized balls,which can be stored as independent units.Unlike a file system, if the file is in HDFS is smaller than block size, then it doesn't occupy complete block?s size, i.e. 5 MB of file stored in HDFS of block size 128 MB takes 5MB of distance only.The HDFS block size is big merely to minimize the price of search.Title Node: HDFS functions in master-worker pattern in which the title node functions as http://master.Name Node is control and director of HDFS because it understands the standing along with the metadata of all of the files in HDFS; the metadata information being file permission, titles and location of every block.The metadata are modest, therefore it is stored in the memory of title node,allowing quicker access to information. Additionally the HDFS bunch is accessed by multiple clients simultaneously,so all this information is managed bya single machine. The file system operations like opening, closing, renaming etc. . implemented by it. They report back to title node periodically, with list of cubes that they're storing. The information node being a commodity hardware also does the job of block creation, deletion and replication according to the title node.MapReduce in Big Data and Hadoop training?To take the benefit of concurrent processing of Hadoop, the question has to be in MapReduce form. The MapReduce is a paradigm which includes two stages, the mapper stage along with the reducer stage. In the Mapper the input is given in the kind of key value pair. The output of this mapper is fed to the reducer as input. The reducer runs just following the mapper is finished. The reducer too takes input in crucial value format and also the output signal of reducer is final output signal.Measures in Map Reduce in Big Data and Hadoop training?Map Requires a information in the Kind of pairs and returns a list of pairs.Using the output of Map, shuffle and sort are applied from the Hadoop architecture. This kind and shuffle functions on those list of pairs also sends out unique keys along with a list of values associated with this unique key .Output of type and shuffle will soon be transmitted to reducer stage.What is Pig in Big Data and Hadoop training?Apache Pig is a high level data stream system for execution Map Reduce apps of Hadoop.The Pig scripts have internally converted to Map Reduce tasks and get implemented on data stored in HDFS. Every task which may be achieved using PIG may also be achieved using coffee employed in Map reduction.Utilization of Pig in Big Data and Hadoop training?Let us see the three use of Pig technology in Big Data and Hadoop Course.Benefits of programming :Writing complex coffee programs for map decrease is quiet tough for non developers. Pig makes this process simple. In pig, the queries are changed to map decrease internally.The manner in which jobs have been encoded permits the machine to optimize their execution automatically, allowing the user to concentrate on semantics as opposed to efficiency.Extensibility: User defined function are written in which the user may write their own logic to perform within the information collection.What is Sqoop in Big Data and Hadoop training?It supports incremental loads of a single table or a free form SQL query in addition to saved jobs which could be run multiple times to import updates made to a database since the previous import.Using Sqoop, Data could be transferred into HDFS/hive/hbase out of MySQL/ PostgreSQL/Oracle/SQL Server/DB2 and vise versa.Sqoop Working in Big Data and Hadoop training?Measure 1: Sqoop send the petition to Relational DB to deliver the yield the metadata informationabout the dining table(Metadata here is the information about the dining table in relational DB).Measure 2: In the received information it will create the java classes (Reason why you shouldhave Java configured until purchase it working-Sqoop internally uses JDBC API to create data).Measure 3: Today Sqoop (As its written in java ? Tries to pack the compiled classes to beable togenerate table arrangement) , article compiling generates jar file(Java packaging standard).Why i am telling you Techstack is best.

Because the work requirements exceed the capabilities of a single computer, this becomes a challenge of pooling, allocating, and coordinating resources from groups of computers.Velocity: It is the speed that information moves through the system. Data is frequently flowing into the system from multiple sources and is often expected to be processed in time to gain understanding and update the current vision of the system.Variety: Data can be ingested from internal systems like application and server logs, from social media feeds and other external APIs, from physical device sensors, and from other providers. Big data seeks to handle potentially useful data regardless of where it's coming from by conjoining all information into a single system.Activities Involved in Big Data Processing.Types of Big Data Technology:Operational Technology- Operational system provides operational capabilities for real-time workloads where data is primarily captured and stored. It includes customer, inventory and purchase data. This system supports high volume low latency access. One such example is NoSQL databases.Analytical Technology- Analytical systems provide analytical capabilities for complex analysis that may touch most or all of the data. Analytical Data is used to make business decisions.Organizations are increasingly turning to big data to discover new ways to improve decision-making, opportunities, and overall performance. For example, big data can be optimized to address the challenges that arise when information that is dispersed across several different systems that are not connected by a central system.By assembling data across systems, big data can help improve decision-making capability. It also can augment data warehouse solutions by serving as a buffer to process new data for inclusion in the data warehouse.Madrid Software Trainings is rated as the best Hadoop Institute in Delhi.Big data can lead to improvements in overall operations by giving organizations greater visibility into operational issues. Operational insights might depend on machine data, which can include anything from computers to sensors or meters to GPS devices.Big data provides unprecedented insight into customers’ decision-making processes by allowing companies to track and analyze shopping patterns, recommendations, purchasing behavior and other drivers that are known to influence sales.With access to real-time data, businesses can enhance security and intelligence analysis platforms. They can also process, store and analyze a wider variety of data types to improve intelligence, security and law enforcement.If you have heard of the Big Data Courses in Delhi, you must have a little idea of big data video analytics. There are various analytics tools for use on the structured data and analysis of unstructured data in the video format is still an area needs to be discovered as far as analysis is concerned.Hadoop should also improve its capabilities to be efficient to start the analysis of the big data. Hadoop Classes in Delhi can be really helpful in such a scenario.A quick look at the data gathered around the world shows that 80% of all the data is available in the unstructured format. The challenge is that the presently available analysis tools can only analyze the structured data.Another data reveals that YouTube has been getting uploads of a huge amount of video data with each passing day. This huge number of data needs another solid analytical tool for analysis.Hadoop is an open source technology, Combination of various frameworks.

What is Big Data According to Wikipedia, Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. In simpler terms,Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any organization is successful in managing its data well, it can easily reach its target in very short span than the usual time. But how the organizations manage it?Hadoop – Solution for Big Data Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications, licensed under the Apache v2 license. It supports the running of applications on large clusters of commodity hardware.Hadoop was derived from Google’s Map/Reduce and Google File System (GFS) papers. Hadoop is written in the Java programming language and is an Apache top-level project being built and used by a global community of contributors. Hadoop and its related projects (Hive, HBase, Zookeeper, and so on) have many contributors from across the ecosystem. Though Java code is most common, any programming language can be used with “streaming” to implement the “map” and “reduce” parts of the system.Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2005. Cutting, who was working at Yahoo at the time, named it after his son’s toy elephant. It was originally developed to support distribution for the Nutch search engine project.

761,"Madrid Software TrainingsLast year, I decided to enroll myself for the Hadoop course to anticipate career growth. When I decided it, I was not aware that it would be difficult to find a good institute in Delhi as there were many. I was searching for it because I did not wish to compromise at this important phase of my career which could influence my professional growth. I started my search that included online, referral and consulting my seniors. Finally, I made up my mind and started visiting institutes in Delhi, Madrid Software Training Institute in Delhi. Located at South Delhi, it gives you an easy access by metro route from anywhere in Delhi.I enquired about the courses they were offering and got to know that apart from Hadoop training in Delhi, they also offer other courses on Machine learning and Data Science. While going through their list of professional courses, I realized that anyone who is looking for a successful career in the field of data science can surely get benefit here. The institute provides all the related courses here apart from Hadoop training in Delhi. I was fine with the syllabus of Hadoop course they were offering because it has the flexibility which eases you off. I had no idea of data science and being a simple graduate person, I was glad to know that they teach you from basic. On the other hand, if you have knowledge of Java and other languages, it will be an added on advantage for those as they have courses where you can make the most of it and learn Hadoop in short duration as well.I already took my first step to choose the Madrid Software Training Solutions, which is known as one of the best institutes for Hadoop learning in Delhi/NCR. Another factor that was bothering me, timing because I was working full time. But soon my worries ended when they told me that they offer classes in late evening which means I could directly come here after office without waiting for the weekend. I was overjoyed because neither I want to leave job nor I wanted to wait for weekend classes.So, like most of you, my next concern was the fee factor. I enquired about it and found it little higher as compared to other institutes. But as I shared my other concerns were resolved here so I agreed. By the end of my course, I can say that the fee they charge is absolutely worth it. Being a student, what you expect, nice environment, experienced faculty, flexible timing and administration support and I got it all there.I would say that Faculty at the Madrid Software in Delhi is well-versed with the subject and they possess sound knowledge. Most of the faculty members are professional who carry practical experience in Hadoop learning. So, that comes as an extra advantage for all of us. I was fortunate enough to attend a trial class. The one day class helped me understand whether I would be getting benefit here or not. I was quite satisfied with the trial class.Besides this, few factors I would like to share are the environment, administration and location. Though it is located in the bustling area of South Delhi, yet you will find the peaceful ambience once you enter the institute. Not only this, the administration staff is also very cooperative. They understand the students’ concern and take it on priority to come up with a solution without delay. Let’s understand what Big Data is and why Hadoop learning has become so important these days!Big Data Hadoop-Points to Know!A decade ago if you ask any question about Big Data, that would have gone in vain. Then people were not aware of the Big Data. Though there were computers and internet as well but storing and processing huge amount of data was still something people were not aware. Companies developed Big Data related technologies considering the future scenario where it is surely going to be required. Finally, they have developed Hadoop, which seems as the perfect solution for the same.Many companies have not started realizing the advantage of Big Data analytics. It has assisted them to gain better business insights that further enhance their decision-making capabilities. As companies have now started showing interest in Big Data and the outcome is that these companies are looking for Hadoop professionals. The demand of jobs in the field of Big Data and Hadoop is rising at a rapid rate. If anyone is interested in the field of analyzing data and wish to pursue his career in the same field, it is the right time to start learning Hadoop without delay. There are more chances that this will give you a good start no matter whether you are a fresher or experienced. The huge demand is being observed in corporate field.Big Data is now the modern term which indicates to a collection of complex data sets that is difficult to process. There are few database management tools available, you can use them for data processing applications but they are outdated now. For big companies, it is important to have something specific that can cater to their demands of storing and processing huge data.The data which you can store in traditional database systems by using rows and columns is known as structured data. Whereas data that can be stored partially in traditional database systems is referred to as the semi-structured data. Unorganized data cannot be categorized as structured or semi-structured data. Tweets on twitter form as the perfect example of the unstructured data that is produced in every single minute.So, you must have got an idea that Hadoop professional course has a huge scope of career growth. If you wish to enter the field of data science, You can join Madrid Software Institute if you are living in Delhi/NCR or you can find the best Hadoop institute at your location. But I would recommend keep your checklist ready, so that you can take a better decision.Madrid Software Trainings(M) - 9560785589Plot no.262, 1st Floor, Near ITDC, Westend Marg, Near Saket Metro Station, Saket","Updated May 27, 2018 · Upvoted by  Amit Kataria, lives in New Delhi (2000-present) · Author has 128 answers and 71.7k answer views",1,", lives in New Delhi",https://www.quora.com/profile/Dimple-Kataria-10,5,Dimple Kataria,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Hadoop-and-big-data-training-institutes-in-Delhi-and-NCR,97.0

But before starting I would recommend you to go through the materials available online which will give you an idea about how to start with the course and what should be the objectives of your course. You can go through this Hadoop Certification blog to understand different Hadoop certifications.Edureka provides a good list of Hadoop Tutorial videos. I would recommend you to go through this Hadoop tutorial video playlist as well as Hadoop Tutorial blog series. Your learning should be aligned with Big Data Certifications.First understand Big Data and challenges associated with Big Data. So , that you can understand how Hadoop emerged as a solution to those Big Data problems. This What is Hadoop and Hadoop Tuorial blog will introduce you to that.Then you should understand how Hadoop architecture works in respect of HDFS, YARN & MapReduce.Further moving on you should install Hadoop on your system so that you can start working with Hadoop. This will help you in understanding the practical aspects in detail.Further moving on take a deep dive into Hadoop Ecosystem and learn various tools inside Hadoop Ecosystem with their functionalities. So, that you will learn how to create a tailored solution according to your requirements.Let us understand in brief:What is Big Data?Big Data is a term used for a collection of data sets that are large and complex, which is difficult to store and process using available database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenge includes capturing, curating, storing, searching, sharing, transferring, analyzing and visualization of this data.It is characterized by 5 V’s.VOLUME: Volume refers to the ‘amount of data’, which is growing day by day at a very fast pace.VELOCITY: Velocity is defined as the pace at which different sources generate the data every day. This flow of data is massive and continuous.VARIETY: As there are many sources which are contributing to Big Data, the type of data they are generating is different. It can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured.VALUE: It is all well and good to have access to big data but unless we can turn it into value it is useless. Find insights in the data and make benefit out of it.VERACITY: Veracity refers to the data in doubt or uncertainty of data available due to data inconsistency and incompleteness.What is Hadoop & it’s architecture?The main components of HDFS are NameNode and DataNode.NameNodeIt is the master daemon that maintainsand manages the DataNodes (slave nodes). It records the metadata of all the files stored in the cluster, e.g. location of blocks stored, the size of the files, permissions, hierarchy, etc. It records each and every change that takes place to the file system metadata.For example, if a file is deleted in HDFS, the NameNode will immediately record this in the EditLog. It regularly receives a Heartbeat and a block report from all the DataNodes in the cluster to ensure that the DataNodes are live. It keeps a record of all the blocks in HDFS and in which nodes these blocks are stored.DataNodeThese are slave daemons which runs on each slave machine. The actual data is stored on DataNodes. They are responsible for serving read and write requests from the clients. They are also responsible for creating blocks, deleting blocks and replicating the same based on the decisions taken by the NameNode.For processing , we use YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator). The components of YARN are ResourceManager and NodeManager.ResourceManagerIt is a cluster level (one for each cluster) component and runs on the master machine. It manages resources and schedule applications running on top of YARN.NodeManagerIt is a node level component (one on each node) and runs on each slave machine. It is responsible for managing containers and monitoring resource utilization in each container. It also keeps track of node health and log management. It continuously communicates with ResourceManager to remain up-to-date .So, you can perform parallel processing on HDFS using MapReduce.MapReduceIt is the core component of processing in a Hadoop Ecosystem as it provides the logic of processing. In other words, MapReduce is a software framework which helps in writing applications that processes large data sets using distributed and parallel algorithms inside Hadoop environment. In a MapReduce program, Map() and Reduce() are two functions.The Map function performs actions like filtering, grouping and sorting.While Reduce function aggregates and summarizes the result produced by map function.The result generated by the Map function is a key value pair (K, V) which acts as the input for Reduce function.You can go through this video to understand Hadoop & it’s architecture in detail.Install Hadoop Single Node and Multi Node ClusterThen you can go through this Hadoop Ecosystem blog to learn Hadoop Ecosystem in detail.You can also go through this Hadoop Ecosystem tutorial video.PigPIG has two parts: Pig Latin, the language and the pig runtime, for the execution environment. You can better understand it as Java and JVM. It supports pig latin language.As everyone does not belong from a programming background. So, Apache PIG relieves them. You might be curious to know how?Well, I will tell you an interesting fact:10 line of pig latin = approx. 200 lines of Map-Reduce Java codeBut don’t be shocked when I say that at the back end of Pig job, a map-reduce job executes. The compiler internally converts pig latin to MapReduce. It produces a sequential set of MapReduce jobs, and that’s an abstraction (which works like black box). PIG was initially developed by Yahoo. It gives you a platform for building data flow for ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), processing and analyzing huge data sets.HiveFacebook created HIVE for people who are fluent with SQL. Thus, HIVE makes them feel at home while working in a Hadoop Ecosystem. Basically, HIVE is a data warehousing component which performs reading, writing and managing large data sets in a distributed environment using SQL-like interface.HIVE + SQL = HQLThe query language of Hive is called Hive Query Language(HQL), which is very similar like SQL. Hive is highly scalable. As, it can serve both the purposes, i.e. large data set processing (i.e. Batch query processing) and real time processing (i.e. Interactive query processing). Hive gets internally gets converted into MapReduce programs.It supports all primitive data types of SQL. You can use predefined functions, or write tailored user defined functions (UDF) also to accomplish your specific needs.You can store data in HBase based on you requirements.HBaseHBase is an open source, non-relational distributed database. In other words, it is a NoSQL database. It supports all types of data and that is why, it’s capable of handling anything and everything inside a Hadoop ecosystem. It is modelled after Google’s BigTable, which is a distributed storage system designed to cope up with large data sets.The HBase was designed to run on top of HDFS and provides BigTable like capabilities. It gives us a fault tolerant way of storing sparse data, which is common in most Big Data use cases. The HBase is written in Java, whereas HBase applications can be written in REST, Avro and Thrift APIs.For better understanding, let us take an example.

767,"Techs tackIBN is dropping its own Hadoop system and adopting Hortonworks Inc.'h rather simply because part of a two-way deal that could give users of both businesses improved gain access to enterprise-class features for managing and analyzing big data.IBM shall end advancement of BigInsights, its distribution of Hadoop, and function to migrate existing users to the Hortonworks Data System (HDP). In come back, Hortonworks will resell IBM's Data Science Knowledge collection of tools for collaborative analytics, as well as Big SQL, a SQL-on-Hadoop problem engine created by IBM. The two companies will perform joint development to increase the features of Apache Atlas also, an open supply data governance construction spearheaded by Hortonworks.The offer should be ""a shot in the arm"" for the product offerings of both vendors, Ovum analyst Tony Baer said at DataWorks Summit 2017 in San Jose, Calif., where the offer was announced.IBM ""gets to say a Hadoop is had by them strategy once again,"" after facing common doubts about the long term of BigInsights over the previous two years, Baer said. And Hortonworks can today present its users a data technology platform to help them organize work on advanced analytics applications, matching technologies released by Hadoop rival Cloudera Inc previously. and many analytics vendors, in addition to IBM.\During the conference's opening keynote session, Take advantage of Thomas, total supervisor of IBM Analytics, said inclined on HDP because the root Hadoop system will allow IBM concentrate more upon developing its data technology and model learning systems. That features will then be produced obtainable to both Hortonworks and IBM users through the Data Technology Experience, which IBM shortens to DSX.Machine learning shows up to the foreThe heightened concentrate on products like DSX and Cloudera's rival Data Research Workbench aligns with the growing utilization of machine learning and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) cited by various attendees at the conference, which was organized simply by Hortonworks and its former parent company, Yahoo.For example, Duke Energy Corp. is definitely searching to make use of machine learning and AI equipment to determine potential gear complications by analyzing sensor data from its transmitting network, said David Pressley, movie director of details structures at the electrical power and organic gas supplier in Charlotte, In.C.Machine learning fueled by data science techniques could allow more proactive and customized customer service also, Pressley said during a consumer -panel conversation.""Where we need to take it next is usually more streaming and current information therefore there's nothing at all that halts us from answering a customer's call and understanding what their sentiment is usually on that telephone contact,"" he stated. ""And after that we can become changing [promotional] offers as we obtain to understand what that customer's most essential thing is usually.""In the mean time, the prepared advancement function about Atlas indicators a continuing height of data governance and security as important issues in big data conditions, according to Gartner analyst Merv Adrian.""The large majority of Hadoop adopters that are currently stalled in attempting to get to wide creation use will want to handle those problems when and if they break the logjam,"" Adrian said. IBM's participation with Atlas could offer ""actual trustworthiness and encounter"" to the still-emerging governance technology, he added.But the move increases questions about an existing Hadoop platform collaboration between Microsoft and Hortonworks. In addition, the consolidation is continued by it of the Hadoop market, which can be now down to four suppliers: Hortonworks and guy big data professionals Cloudera and MapR Systems, plus cloud-platform marketplace innovator Amazon . com Internet Solutions.An fresh air of inevitability for IBMIBM's decision to throw in its great deal with Hortonworks on Hadoop follows a similar move by Pivotal Software program in Apr 2016. At the right time, market experts wondered how very long IBM would keep out on offering its very own Hadoop system, in light of its teaming up with Hortonworks specifically, Pivotal and various other businesses in 2015 on the ODPi work to create common research specs for different Hadoop distributions.Discover even more PRO+ content material and other member just gives, here.E-HandbookBig data users talk about their attempting but being successful analytics war storiesE-ZineEffective data visualization crystallizes a company's crystal ballE-ChapterAdvanced analytics tools draw out business benefit from big dataThe mothballing of BigInsights in favor of HDP ""seems inevitable in hindsight,"" Adrian said. ""IBM had mainly because many programmers simply because customers on BigInsights likely. And many of its users had been essentially 'provided' the providing as component of bigger offers -- utilization tales possess been few and much between.""Garner analystIBM declined to disclose the true quantity of existing BigInsights users that would end up being affected by the deal.Microsoft is in the Hortonworks camp also, having built its cloud-based Violet HDInsight managed support for big data users on best of HDP. A Microsoft professional who talked during the starting keynote program at the DataWorks Peak did not point out the Hortonworks-IBM offer or HDInsight; a spokesman for Microsoft stated the business had no comment on the new agreement later.IBM's take hold of HDP will boost the size of the Hortonworks client bottom, said Jamie Engesser, vice chief executive of item administration in Hortonworks. That, in change, ""provides Microsoft a larger focus on base for shifting workloads to the cloud,"" Engesser said. ""They can provide IBM users great choices to operate existing workloads or fresh types in the [Orange] cloud.""Both Adrian and Baer described the relationship between Microsoft and Hortonworks as effective for the two companies thus far. The deal with IBM likely won't lead to many deployments of HDP on IBM's Bluemix cloud platform as an alternate to HDInsight, Adrian stated, but selecting between IBM and Microsoft in competitive circumstances ""will end up being an interesting problem"" for Hortonworks.For Horton works' own users, DSX presents an even more enterprise-ready workbench environment for data researchers than the Apache Zeppelin laptop tool that the firm has been giving, Engesser said.

769,"TechstackA goal for just about any organization doing business online is the ability to pull together all the data it has on its customers so it can offer specific products to shoppers in real time as they move through the “customer journey.”Trans america, the insurance and investment giant, tackled that challenge in 2015 with its Enterprise Marketing and Analytics Platform, which allows the company to bring together data from numerous business lines and customer contacts into one holistic view. E MAP is a distributed, salable and secure platform for storing and accessing data (structured, semi-structured and unstructured) through a Hardtop data lake.Today, EMAP helps Trans america understand and improve the customer experience from first outreach to continuing customer-retention efforts.We need these fundamental understandings to fuel innovations in product development and service delivery,” said Gerard Rescigno, Transamerica’s executive vice president and chief technology officerForging closer ties with customersTrans america, a holding company for U.S.-focused life insurance companies and investment firms, is a subsidiary of Dutch life insurance multinational Argon. Trans america provides life and supplemental health insurance, investment and retirement services to 27 million customers.The size of its customer base and the number of its financial-service products can results in missed opportunities. However, Trans america uses E MAP to create a comprehensive view of its clients.The Trans america Tower in Baltimore“We analyze our customer interactions and behaviors across all our channels,” Ignore said. “How do they connect with us? What do they look at, want or need? What do they say to us in our voice response systems?”The company integrates data from across its insurance, retirement and investment lines of business with third-party data. EMAP pulls in data from more than 40 sources, including consumer income and social media data.All that information is used to identify new patterns, according to a 2016 joint presentation by Transamerica and Cloudera, one of its vendors.Transamerica then personalize its digital offerings and interactions to suit a given customer or website visitor. “We’re using data to improve our responsiveness and ability to predict customers’ needs,” Rescigno said. For instance, knowing which products to offer customers who are parents of young children versus empty-nesters nearing retirement.The building blocksTransamerica decided to tackle its data analytics challenges with a Hadoop-based data lake, which it believed would be more versatile, more powerful and less expensive than a traditional data warehouse solution. Hadoop, part of the Apache open-source project, is a programming framework for processing and storing huge data sets in a distributed computing environment.The company uses Cloudera’s distributed Enterprise Data Hub for storing structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Informatica’s Big Data Management (BDM) product handles the vital data management functions, the company said, including data ingestion and integration, data profiling and data quality.Also See: How GoDaddy powers its team with big data analyticsTransamerica uses different processing engines, such as MapReduce, to parcel out work to various nodes and organize the results. The company also deployed Spark, a fast, in-memory data processing engine that’s particularly efficient with SQL and machine learning.Using an abstraction layer to build data pipelines provides Transamerica with an architecture that can quickly utilize new processing engines as they become available, the company said. For example, Transamerica started with MapReduce but more often use the faster Apache Spark.Transamerica relies significantly on machine learning to draw insight from its data. Machine learning automates data analysis through algorithms that iteratively learn to uncover insights they weren’t specifically programmed to find. The company uses H2O, an open source machine learning platform. Using H2O, Transamerica leverages in-memory distributed processing on Hadoop and lets data scientists run large numbers of machine learning models using common programming languages for big data, such as R, Python and Scala.The insurer also utilizes a set of analytics solutions, notably Alteryx and Datameer, allowing analysts to perform additional computation.The results are presented using Tableau, which integrates with Hadoop, to provide visualization and dashboarding capabilities within the organization.The EMAP platform is also designed to maintain the security and appropriate use of the information. Use of personally identifiable information (PII) is also subject to the oversight of Transamerica’s Data Governance Council. The company said that this group is tasked to help ensure that data is secure and is used consistently with customer interests and legal and regulatory obligations.Thanks to EMAP, Transamerica has fuller access to data that was previously fragmented and siloed, often in legacy systems. Not only is the company able to work with more of its growing data, but it’s able to do so much faster than in the pre-EMAP days.Big data in practiceTransamerica’s data science and analytics teams now use the EMAP platform to develop, test and deploy predictive models. In the past, the teams were challenged with large data sets that the company couldn’t process efficiently. They are now able to leverage in-memory processing on Hadoop to run models in minutes instead of days. The ability to run queries against the data and obtain answers quickly translates into reduced processing cycles and infrastructure demands.The company said its effort has made it easier for teams in Transamerica’s technology, business and analytics groups to focus on the customer relationship. The cross-functional collaboration has provided a framework for future joint projects.The company said it is more agile and better able to explore new ideas for how it interacts with, and serves, its customers.EMAP gives us new insights into consumer behavior that we would not have been able to isolate before. We are frequently surprised at what we discover when insights are revealed,” Rescigno said. “They are serendipitous in a way.”Brian McDonoughMore from this AuthorHow Slack uses big data to grow its businessCommentsLogin or RegisterWeb Seminar Analytics for all: How to make your entire business smarterAnalyticsWith the right analytics and the right data, everyone can make better decisions faster.

Most organizations simply don’t have a good understanding of the underlying data they collect and store, and more time is spent searching for data rather than actually analyzing it.While most organizations have huge expectations of how BI will deliver exciting, and potentially groundbreaking insights, they are often disappointed in the results unless they already know where to find the data they need to perform data analysis in the first place.Managing Data as an AssetData is an asset and should be treated as such, which means that managing your data intelligence is just as important as managing your BI. If BI is understanding the key metrics to manage your business, then DI is understanding the key metrics to manage your data: Where is it located? What is its quality? Who is using it? What is its provenance?Organizations can increase their data intelligence quotient (D-IQ) by developing an understanding of how to connect the right data to the people that need to use it. The implication is that if you’re going to treat data as an asset, you must treat it like you would physical inventory: that is, making the entire life cycle measurable.For example, if you needed a “1-4-20x1 Black Carriage Bolt” when building a structure, you wouldn’t buy spare parts, dump them into a big pile on the floor and then sort through that pile just for that bolt. Instead, you would organize it somewhere in your spare parts storage, so you can find that bolt quickly when you need to use it.The same is true for data. If you want to properly manage it as an asset, you need to organize your data so it is easy to find when people need it.Strategically managing your data in order to improve your organization’s D-IQ requires both an offensive and a defensive approach.Offensive DI is concerned with how companies use their data to positively affect new business outcomes, such as increased revenues or improved critical business processes.Meanwhile, defensive DI is what helps companies “stay out of jail” when it comes to collecting, managing and using their data sets. With new compliance mandates popping up frequently, data governance and defensive DI are key components of a company’s overall data management strategy.But being smart about data entails identifying investments that are leveragable for both offense and defense.Data Catalogs for Offensive Data IntelligenceThe organizations today that are successfully raising their offensive DI quotient are moving from doing BI within a business unit to figuring out how to perform cross-business unit and cross-organization data analysis more effectively.For example, if you are a large fast food chain and you are trying to figure out how to reduce the shelf life of your in-store inventory from a week to only a few days, you need to track your beef patty supply all the way back to the cows that were sourced for them. This means analyzing data from a myriad of sources, which includes your restaurants, the trucks that move the food, the warehouses that store the food and the farm data about the cows themselves.The challenge in doing this kind of analysis that involves multiple data sources is that the data is not labeled consistently between those sources. Thus, as you move between the different data sets, the analysis becomes even less consistent when you go across business units and increasingly less consistent when you cross companies.As it turns out, this is why most big data projects get stalled or fail. When data is dumped into a data warehouse or a data lake, the lack of consistency in the data prevents this kind of analysis from being done.One must get the process of cataloging the data (connecting a business term down to the technical term used to describe a column of data) right to ensure the success of big data projects.For example, what a trucking company might refer to as “freight item,” a restaurant might refer to as “food item,” but they may in fact be referring to the same thing. This might sound simple, but when you multiply this by thousands or tens of thousands of terms that are all called something different, this quickly becomes a problem of “death by a thousand paper cuts.”Fortunately, data cataloging tools automate the process of figuring out that the two attributes with a different label are in fact the same.Once this problem of identifying the same data item with different labels is solved, all kinds of revenue-generating and cost-savings analytics can be done. But once again, it all presumes that you are using a common, consistent language across different data sets, business units and companies.Defensive Data IntelligenceThe functions of a data catalog can also be used for defensive DI, which is focused on protecting companies from falling out of compliance with governmental regulations. Most, if not all of these regulations, have to do with the protection of sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) or personal health information (PHI).This is true for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR ) out of the EU, which is the most recent compliance mandate affecting companies’ data assets. But to protect this information and properly control access, you first have to know where it is.Once again, a data catalog can help by automatically identifying which items are the same, even though they have different labels. So even if a column name is called “C01,” which is not particularly helpful, the data catalog can automatically determine, by using machine learning techniques, that “C01” is a social security number, “C02” is a last name, and so on.Leveraging Defense and OffenseThe nice thing about data catalogs is that the effort that goes into a defensive project can also be leveraged for an offensive project, and vice versa. If you are going through the exercise of labeling data for the supply chain example above, at the same time you can also flag sensitive data that is sitting right next to it for compliance mandates.Another example of an organization using both offensive and defensive data intelligence strategies comes from the financial services industry, in which a business used the data catalog to identify sensitive data as part of their GDPR process. As part of that exercise, they used the automatic discovery capabilities of their data catalog to tag all of their data, not just their sensitive data, and discovered that they are buying the same raw data from the same supplier in multiple countries.Essentially, they were paying for the exact same data two or three separate times because different business units in different countries weren’t aware that another part of the company had already purchased that data. In the end, eliminating redundant purchasing of this data resulted in millions of dollars in savings.Increase Your Data IQ to Ace Big DataData Value Acceleration is decreasing the amount of time it takes for companies and organizations to realize the value to be gained from their data assets. Simply stated, cataloging your data gives you a better understanding of what data you have, where it is located, as well as who should and shouldn’t have access to it.If you plan carefully, the seemingly simple exercise of populating a data catalog can be leveraged to increase both your offensive and your defensive D-IQ, thereby providing value across multiple use cases for your organization.Alex GodlikeAlex GodlikeAlex Godlike is the chief executive officer at Waterline Data.More ArticlesDon't want your cyber attacked?

However, with advancements in artificial intelligence, this is set to change.That's according to Nathan Root, VP of insights and data for insurance at consultancy Capgemini Financial Services. Root, formerly an SVP in charge of underwriting transformation at CNA, says that AI's impact on claims can drastically reduce cycle time.Insurers are using AI technology to analyze their old paper claims, submission applications, and policies. These digitized documents can then be subject to analytics that can inform carriers' policy and claim strategies going forward.“Within the claims process, insurance companies are looking to deliver a better outcome and an overall better customer service experience,” Root says.For example, he says, AI is allowing companies to dramatically cut claim routing times. Companies he is working with are using AI and data analytics to create a system where a new claim can automatically be routed to an adjuster depending on the severity of the claim and the experience of the adjuster. This cuts the process of assigning a claim from days to just minutes.In order to deliver this improved experience, Capgemini works with clients to combine the growing abilities of AI software to understand natural language with existing technology, such as character recognition, to digitize the data in their new claims.Root described the maturity of the big data and analytics capabilities when it comes to mining old claims as “mainstream"" -- but it hasn't yet peaked, he says. For example, there's still a lot of potential for insurance companies to use AI to automate data collection and analysis.It has not yet hit its threshold of maturity,” he said. “In five years, it will be more mainstream and more mature. It will get more innovative with machine learning.Big Data Hadoop Training in Delhi | Techstack InstituteTechstack133 A , Lane no 1 , Westend Marg Behind Saket Metro Gate no 2, Saidul-al-Ajaib, New Delhi-110030P:+91 9911941144, +91 9911921144","Answered Jul 7, 2017",1,", lives in New Delhi (2014-present)",https://www.quora.com/profile/Amit-Singh-4321,13,Amit Singh,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Hadoop-and-big-data-training-institutes-in-Delhi-and-NCR,97.0

772,"Madrid Software Trainings - Best Institute in Delhi Ncr For HadoopWhile coming across the list of best Hadoop institutes in Delhi, you may get confused as they abound. But like always words of mouth is an effective medium to end your dilemma. I was in same dilemma couple of years back and my search ended with Madrid Software Training Institute in Delhi. It is one of those institutes that I came across while browsing for best institutes in Delhi and I decided to visit the same.But before that, I made a checklist of the things I was looking for in my Hadoop training in Delhi. My checklist included all the things that could influence my decision of relying on any institute. It had first of all the flexibility of timing as I was not in mood of affecting my job. So I decided to pursue the course after my job hours. The step I took was quite evident because like other corporate professionals, I too wish to make the most of my time to accelerate my career growth. I was fortunate enough to know that this Hadoop institute in Delhi[1] provides training in various batches to meet the demands of students as well as professionals. I picked up the evening time and decided to enroll myself in.Second important thing was the courses fee. I was kind of struggling with financial constraints yet never wanted this to affect my career goals anyway. When I checked in Madrid Software Trainings, I got to know about the various courses and fee as per their duration. Though it was not so less yet I was relaxed to know that I could manage paying the fee as it was reasonable enough for a professional like me. By the time, I got to know about the fee and timings; I made up my mind to join the institute. But then, I wanted to be sure about certain other things. So I continued probing about the same.Another thing that was bothering me; the quality of training! Upon exploring, I found out that they were offering a trial class. Without delay, I enrolled for the trial class. Though it was just for one day yet it helped me to see the clear picture of what I would learn and the learning environment. I found out the trainers were experienced professionals with in-depth understanding of the Hadoop training.Though I was taught basic of Hadoop but there only I realized that I could enroll for a special program that will help me enhance my knowledge in Hadoop because I had java training already. Not only this, the trial class also helped me to decide on the course as there were few options available. These courses were designed keeping in mind the varied requirements of students. There were courses for professionals like me who already had knowledge of Java and there were courses to entertain new students who can start afresh.As a technology enthusiast, I keep on learning about new advancements. So I had an idea about Hadoop which after attending the course also got more clarity. After completing my course from Madrid software trainings institute in Delhi, I started appearing for interview. Here is the list of few frequently asked questions.How do you define Big Data?Big Data is a latest term which denotes to a collection of complex data sets which is hard to store and process. Thought there are already few database management tools available but by using them or outdated data processing applications, it becomes little difficult to go along with latest transformation. The challenges encompass capturing, storing, curating, sharing, searching, analyzing, transferring and visualization of the data.How would you differentiate between Structured and Unstructured data?Data that can be stored in traditional database systems using rows and columns is defined as structured data. Whereas data that can be stored only partially in traditional database systems is referred to as the semi-structured data. Unorganized and raw data cannot be categorized as structured or semi structured data, it is only unstructured data. Tweets on twitter and updates on Facebook or reviews on products serve as the examples of unstructured data.What are the ways to characterize Data?Data can be simply characterized by 5 V’s. First one is Volume which denotes to the amount of data that is growing at a rapid pace. Then comes the Velocity which is the pace at which various sources produce the data every day. The data flow here is continuous and massive. Third one is the Variety which refers to various sources that help in Big Data generation type. It can be in any form structured, semi-structured or even unstructured. Next is Value which helps in having access to big data but without turning it in value, it is useless. Last one is Veracity, which is the data in doubt that happens because of data inconsistency.Define the concept on which the Hadoop framework works.Hadoop Framework works on two components. First one is HDFS which means Hadoop Distributed File System. This Java based file system is used for scalable storage of huge datasets. Data is stored here in the form of blocks and operates on the Master Slave Architecture.Second one is Hadoop Map Reduce which is a java based paradigm of Hadoop framework. It offers scalability across different Hadoop clusters. Map Reduce efficiently distributes the workload into different tasks that can run simultaneously. Hadoop jobs perform 2 different jobs. The map job breaks down the data sets into different key-value tuples. The reduce job is to take the output of the map job and combine it into smaller set of tuples. The reduce job is performed once the map job is executed.Can you name some companies that use Big Data Hadoop?The worldwide popular names are in the list of companies that are using Hadoop. Starting from Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, it continues to have big names like Netflix, eBay, Twitter, Hulu and Spotify.If you are also looking for Hadoop Courses in Delhi, you may consider giving this institute a thought and can enroll yourself for the course that excites you.http://www.madridsoftwaretrainin...Footnotes[1] Professional Big Data Hadoop Training Delhi | Big Data Analytics - Hadoop Institutes Noida and Gurgaon","Updated May 14, 2018 · Upvoted by  Amit Kataria, lives in New Delhi (2000-present)",1,", lives in New Delhi",https://www.quora.com/profile/Madrid-Soft,16,Madrid Soft,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Hadoop-and-big-data-training-institutes-in-Delhi-and-NCR,97.0

775,"Learning a new course can be fun and self studying is good but one thing I have learned while self studying that subject gets messy. I don't know from where should I start or which video on YouTube I should play first.This is where a mentor is needed and coaching institutes do that work for you.They will organize everything for you. The only and most important thing you don't have to worry about is managing the syllabus.I would recommend if you want to learn Hadoop BigData & apply for job quickly - then definitely you should go & select some good training institute for BigData instead of self learning. Definitely self learning is the best but in my case I have tried lot - it was fine till initial level of hadoop hive big data introduction, but later i was direction less to proceed with self study. I realized Big data is very vast & I'm spending too much unnecessary time going into blogs & unnecessary details and was also worried what I would write in my resume for real time big data project.Fortunately I had got good trainer from Technolors(www.technolors.com)- Highly Experienced BigData IIT professional who was also working in the top MNC & was taking hadoop big data classes exclusively on the weekends. He had really focused on the quality training rather than numbers. The course was around 10 weeks- & we have got more than 55 ~ 60 numbers of hours in which he had covered Hadoop Basics & various BigData components including advance concepts - HDFS, MapReduce 1 & generation 2 ,YARN, Hive, Sqoop, Pig, HBase, Flume, Oozie, Impala, Hue & other NoSql technologies, Realtime BigData project with bench-markings & performance tuning tips.Got lot of interview tips & focus on interview preparation during our sessions. We have also received labs, excersices & supporting materials which has really given me the good exposure of interview. The best thing is Trainer has provided guidance to prepare my resume as well & helped me to add Realtime BigData project with roles & responsibilities, which had helped me to get placed in the top organisation for the Big Data role.in-fact, after completing my course also, they had supported me to clarify my doubts/questions till I get finally place for the BigData role.Definitely I would recommend to join Technolors (www.technolors.com) - as it was very nice experience for me & also got quickly job in Big data with very high package.
